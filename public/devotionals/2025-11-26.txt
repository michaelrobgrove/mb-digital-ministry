# The Deceptive Allure of Earthly Riches

Proverbs 19:4 (KJV) presents a sobering, yet deeply insightful observation about human nature in a fallen world: "Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour." This verse, in its stark simplicity, peels back the superficial layers of society to reveal the often-harsh realities of human relationships unanchored by divine love.

Consider the first part: "Wealth maketh many friends." The Bible is clear that the *love* of money is the root of all evil (1 Timothy 6:10), not money itself. However, this proverb highlights how earthly riches can attract a multitude of acquaintances—those who gather around for potential gain, favor, or social standing. These "friends" are often fair-weather companions, their loyalty as fleeting as the temporal possessions that draw them. When the wealth diminishes, so too does their presence. Such relationships are hollow, built on self-interest rather than genuine affection, and offer no true comfort or enduring support. They serve as a poignant warning against placing our trust in worldly status or the superficiality of human connections that are not rooted in something deeper and more eternal.

Then, the proverb turns to the unfortunate plight of "the poor is separated from his neighbour." This paints a sorrowful picture of isolation and neglect. In a world that often values material success, those without resources can find themselves marginalized, overlooked, and abandoned by the very society that might have flocked to the wealthy. It speaks to the painful reality that, apart from God's grace, human hearts can be cold and unfeeling towards those in need, shunning them out of pride, disdain, or a desire to avoid perceived burdens.

As believers in Jesus Christ, we must look beyond these worldly observations to eternal truths. Our ultimate treasure is not found in earthly wealth, nor should our friendships be based on material gain. Our truest Friend, Jesus Christ, never separates Himself from us, whether we are rich or poor in this world. He sought out the outcast, comforted the afflicted, and offered genuine, unconditional love and the promise of salvation.

This proverb calls us to examine our own hearts. Are we pursuing earthly wealth and fleeting friendships, or are we seeking the spiritual riches that endure forever in Christ? Are we quick to judge or neglect those who are less fortunate, or do we extend the hand of Christ-like love and compassion, remembering that we are all created in God’s image and equally in need of His grace? Let us seek relationships built on the solid foundation of Christ's love, and let us be neighbors to all, reflecting the selfless love of our Savior.

Heavenly Father, help us to fix our eyes on eternal riches and cultivate relationships rooted in Christ's unfailing love.
