# The Sweetness of Godly Speech

"Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones." (Proverbs 16:24)

What a beautiful and practical truth the Holy Spirit, through King Solomon, gives us in this Proverb! In a world often filled with harshness, criticism, and negativity, the Lord calls His children to a higher standard of communication. He reminds us that our words carry immense power – the power to build up or to tear down, to heal or to wound.

The verse begins by describing "pleasant words." What constitutes pleasant words from a biblical perspective? It is not mere flattery or insincere niceties. Rather, these are words born of a heart transformed by Christ – words of encouragement, comfort, affirmation, truth spoken in love, and genuine kindness. They are words that lift the fallen, strengthen the weak, and bring solace to the troubled. Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself was the epitome of pleasant words, speaking grace and truth in perfect measure. As believers, our speech should reflect His character, seasoned with salt (Colossians 4:6), bringing glory to God.

When we speak such words, the Proverb states they are "as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul." Imagine the pure, natural sweetness of honey – how it delights the palate and provides nourishment. So it is with pleasant words; they bring deep refreshment and joy to the inner man. They minister to the spirit, quell anxieties, and infuse hope. In a society struggling with loneliness and despair, a simple, heartfelt word of encouragement can be a spiritual lifesaver, offering a taste of God's love to a weary heart.

Furthermore, these words are "health to the bones." This goes beyond mere emotional comfort; it points to a deeper, more profound benefit. "Bones" in Hebrew thought often refer to the deepest part of one's being, the very foundation of health and strength. Pleasant words, therefore, contribute to our holistic well-being – mental, emotional, and even physical. They reduce stress, foster peace, strengthen relationships, and build up the Body of Christ. A steady diet of godly, uplifting communication promotes a healthy spirit and a robust faith, both in the speaker and the hearer.

Let us, as Baptist believers, strive daily to guard our tongues and fill our mouths with words that are pleasant, truthful, and edifying. May our speech be like honey, bringing sweetness to the soul and health to the bones, reflecting the grace of our Saviour.

Lord, help us to speak pleasant words that bring glory to You and minister grace to those around us. Amen.
