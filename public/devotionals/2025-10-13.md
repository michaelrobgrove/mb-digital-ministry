# The Harvest of Our Words: A Reflection on Proverbs 18:20

"A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled." (Proverbs 18:20, KJV)

This profound verse from the book of Proverbs, given to us by divine inspiration, unveils a timeless truth about the incredible power and far-reaching consequences of our words. It tells us that what we speak, what we allow to pass through our lips, will ultimately come back to us, either to satisfy us or to leave us wanting. Our words are not empty air; they are seeds we sow, and like any seed, they will yield a harvest.

Consider the "fruit of his mouth" and the "increase of his lips." This speaks to a principle of sowing and reaping. If we consistently sow words of truth, encouragement, and kindness, we will cultivate relationships built on trust, foster an atmosphere of peace, and often find ourselves receiving similar grace and respect in return. The satisfaction spoken of here is not always material wealth, but a deeper contentment—a clear conscience, healthy fellowship, and the joy of knowing we have been a blessing. Our "belly" or inner man will be filled with the positive outcomes and the spiritual peace that flows from righteous speech.

Conversely, imagine the bitter harvest from lips that sow gossip, criticism, lies, or anger. Such words can destroy reputations, ignite conflicts, and alienate those we claim to love. The "fruit" of such speech is discord, isolation, and a troubled spirit. A heart filled with bitterness will inevitably speak bitter words, and those bitter words, once released, will return to fill us with more of the same. Jesus Himself taught us in Matthew 12:34, "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Our words are a direct reflection of what truly resides within us.

As believers, called to walk in Christ-likeness, we must be diligent stewards of our tongues. Are our words bringing glory to God and edifying to others? Are they seasoned with grace, as Paul admonishes in Colossians 4:6, "Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man"? We are accountable for every idle word, and indeed, for every intentional word.

Let us resolve to speak words that build up, that bless, that bring hope, and that reflect the character of our Savior. When we align our speech with God’s Word and purpose, we will indeed find our lives filled and our souls satisfied with a harvest that is pleasing to God and beneficial to all around us.

Lord, help us to guard our mouths and use our words to bring glory to Your name and blessings to others, that we may be satisfied with the righteous fruit of our lips.
