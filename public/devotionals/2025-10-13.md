# A Reflection on Proverbs 1:8

In this foundational verse from the book of Proverbs, the Holy Spirit, through Solomon, addresses us with a tender yet firm invitation: "My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:" (Proverbs 1:8, KJV). This is not merely good advice from an ancient sage; it is a divine mandate, a principle laid down by God Himself for our well-being and blessing.

The address "My son" speaks to each of us, young and old, reminding us of our position as children under the authority and love of our parents, and ultimately, under our Heavenly Father. God has established the family as the primary institution for teaching, nurturing, and guiding His people. Within this divine design, both father and mother play crucial, complementary roles in shaping a child's character and worldview.

The "instruction of thy father" implies a steadfast, often direct, guidance rooted in experience and divine wisdom. A godly father’s counsel seeks to protect, equip, and direct his children toward paths of righteousness and truth. It is the wisdom passed down, often from his own walk with the Lord, that helps his children navigate the complexities of life. To "hear" this instruction means more than just listening; it means to attend, to understand, and to internalize it into our hearts.

Similarly, we are commanded to "forsake not the law of thy mother." A mother's "law" often encompasses the consistent, nurturing principles and boundaries that form the bedrock of daily life. It is the gentle yet firm guidance, the lessons in kindness, discipline, and godliness that are woven into the fabric of the home. To "forsake not" means to cling to these truths, to remember them, and to apply them throughout our lives, refusing to abandon them for fleeting worldly desires.

When we honor this command, we are not just obeying our earthly parents; we are demonstrating our reverence for God's divine order. We are choosing the path of wisdom over folly, stability over chaos, and blessing over regret. The world often encourages rebellion against authority, but God’s Word consistently calls us to submission and respect, beginning within the home. Let us, therefore, heed this timeless instruction. Let us listen attentively to the wisdom of our godly fathers and hold fast to the righteous laws instilled by our godly mothers, knowing that in doing so, we are walking in obedience to our Creator and preparing ourselves for a life that honors Him.

Heavenly Father, help us to honor and obey the instruction of our parents, knowing it leads to Your blessing and wisdom. Amen.
