# The Enduring Blessings of Fearing the Lord

Proverbs 19:23 (KJV) presents us with a profound truth and a precious promise from God's Holy Word: "The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil." This single verse offers a rich tapestry of divine wisdom for every believer seeking to walk faithfully with the Lord.

First, let us understand what is meant by "the fear of the LORD." This is not a cowering terror or a paralyzing dread, but rather a reverential awe, a humble submission, and a profound respect for the holy, sovereign, and all-powerful God of the universe. It is the recognition of His supreme authority and our utter dependence upon Him. This godly fear naturally leads to obedience to His commands, a desire to please Him, and a turning away from sin. It is the very foundation of true wisdom.

The scripture declares that this fear "tendeth to life." This is not merely physical existence, but a deep, abundant, and spiritual lifeâ€”the very life that Christ offers us through salvation. When we fear the Lord, we align ourselves with His will, and our paths are directed toward righteousness, peace, and spiritual vitality. This life is characterized by purpose, hope, and an eternal perspective that transcends the fleeting pleasures of this world. It is a life lived in communion with our Creator, filled with His guidance and grace.

Furthermore, the one who fears the Lord "shall abide satisfied." In a world constantly chasing after fleeting desires, true satisfaction seems elusive. Yet, God promises contentment to those who put Him first. This satisfaction is not dependent on external circumstances or material possessions; it is a deep-seated peace and fulfillment that comes from knowing God, trusting His providence, and resting in His love. It's the assurance that in Christ, we have all we need, and our souls find their true rest and joy in Him alone.

Finally, the verse promises, "he shall not be visited with evil." This does not guarantee a life devoid of all hardship or trials, for even the most devout believers face tribulations in this fallen world. However, it assures us of God's protective hand, His ultimate victory over sin and death, and His sovereign care. It means that destructive evil will not ultimately prevail against the one who fears Him. God will either shield us from harm, deliver us through it, or use it for our greater good and His glory, preventing it from having a lasting, detrimental spiritual impact on our souls. We are eternally secure in His hands, protected from spiritual ruin and the final sting of evil.

Let us, therefore, cultivate this reverential fear of the Lord daily, trusting in His Word and living in humble obedience, so that we may fully experience the life, satisfaction, and protection He so graciously promises.

Lord, grant us hearts that truly fear You, that we may walk in Your life, abide in Your satisfaction, and rest in Your unchanging protection.
