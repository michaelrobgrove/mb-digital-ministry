# The Company You Keep

"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed." (Proverbs 13:20, KJV)

This profound proverb from the book of wisdom offers a timeless truth that every believer ought to take to heart. It speaks directly to the immense power of influence within our lives, particularly through the company we choose to keep. Our spiritual journey, our character, and even our eternal destiny can be shaped profoundly by those with whom we walk.

The first part of the verse presents a glorious promise: "He that walketh with wise men shall be wise." Who are these "wise men"? In the biblical sense, wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 9:10). These are individuals whose lives are submitted to God's Word, who seek His counsel, and who strive to live righteously. When we intentionally surround ourselves with such godly individuals—fellow believers committed to Christ, mature in their faith, and striving for holiness—we inevitably begin to absorb their virtues. Their prayer life encourages ours, their sound counsel guides us, their steadfastness strengthens us, and their godly example inspires us to walk closer with the Lord. They hold us accountable, lift us up when we stumble, and challenge us to grow in grace and knowledge. This is the essence of true Christian fellowship and discipleship, a vital component of spiritual health.

However, the second part of the verse issues a solemn warning: "but a companion of fools shall be destroyed." Who are these "fools"? Biblically, a fool is not merely someone lacking intelligence, but one who rejects God, scorns His commands, and lives according to their own sinful desires (Psalm 14:1). To align ourselves closely with such individuals—those who mock righteousness, revel in sin, or lead lives contrary to God's will—is to invite spiritual peril. Their influence can subtly, or even overtly, dull our spiritual senses, tempt us towards compromise, corrupt our good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33), and eventually lead us far astray from the path of truth and holiness. The word "destroyed" here points not only to the loss of peace, joy, and testimony in this life, but also to the potential for spiritual shipwreck and eternal consequences if one persists in such folly, away from Christ.

Brothers and sisters, we must prayerfully and critically examine our friendships and associations. Do they draw us closer to God or pull us away? Do they build us up in faith or tear down our convictions? Let us diligently seek out companions who love the Lord, who speak truth into our lives, and whose lives bear the fruit of the Spirit. And as we do so, let us also strive to be such a wise companion for others, reflecting Christ's light in a dark world. Our spiritual well-being depends on it.

Heavenly Father, grant us discernment to choose our companions wisely, that we may walk in Your truth and grow in wisdom, all for Your glory. Amen.
