# True Worth, God's Way

Proverbs 12:9 (KJV) presents us with a striking contrast, challenging our worldly assumptions about success and honor: "He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread." At first glance, this verse might seem counterintuitive to the world's way of thinking. Yet, in its profound simplicity, it reveals God's eternal wisdom regarding true worth and where it is found.

Consider the first part: "He that is despised, and hath a servant." This describes an individual who, by society's standards, may not be highly esteemed or popular. Perhaps they are overlooked, scorned, or simply not seen as significant. However, the phrase "hath a servant" implies a measure of order, responsibility, and practical provision in their life. It doesn't necessarily speak of great wealth, but rather a stable existence, perhaps through diligence or faithful stewardship, allowing for some level of management or assistance. Their humility, whether by choice or circumstance, means they are not seeking the applause of men. They are simply living, perhaps quietly, within God's provision.

Now, juxtapose this with the second part: "he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread." Here we see a person full of pride, self-importance, and a desire for human adulation. He exalts himself, boasts of his accomplishments, and expects to be recognized and praised. Yet, for all his self-honor, he ultimately "lacketh bread." This speaks to a profound destitution, not just in a physical sense, but often spiritually and emotionally. His pride has led him to an empty, bankrupt state. His self-exaltation, rather than bringing him true blessing, has left him void of even the basic necessities, perhaps because his pride prevented him from honest labor, from seeking help, or from acknowledging God as his true Provider.

This proverb powerfully teaches us that God’s standard of value is vastly different from man’s. The Lord despises pride, which is a stumbling block to grace and genuine provision (Proverbs 6:16-17; James 4:6). True honor comes not from self-promotion, but from humility before God and man. It is far better to live a life of quiet faithfulness, humbly dependent on God's provision, even if unnoticed or scorned by the world, than to parade oneself in boastful pride, only to find oneself spiritually and practically bankrupt. Let us seek to be rich in character and faith, relying on God for our daily bread, rather than striving for fleeting human glory that leads to emptiness.

Heavenly Father, help us to cultivate humility and to trust in Your provision, seeking Your honor above our own. Amen.
