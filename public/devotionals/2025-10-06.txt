# The Joy of Righteousness and Justice

"When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting." (Proverbs 11:10)

This verse from Proverbs paints a vivid picture of the impact of two contrasting types of lives on a community. It speaks to the inherent desire for order, peace, and justice that God has placed within humanity, and the joy that accompanies their realization.

First, consider the phrase, "When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth." Who are the righteous? In the light of God's Word, we understand that true righteousness comes not from our own efforts, but is imputed to us by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Through His shed blood and resurrection, we are declared righteous in God’s sight. As believers, we are then called to live out this righteousness in our daily lives, guided by the Holy Spirit. When a city or community has individuals who live with integrity, honesty, compassion, and a fear of God, their presence is a profound blessing. They are the salt and light of the earth, preserving moral truth and illuminating the path of Christ. Their prayers, their good works, their commitment to biblical principles, and their Christ-like character bring stability, peace, and often, the tangible blessings of God upon the entire community. It "goeth well" for them not just in material ways, but in spiritual fortitude and influence, and the community benefits greatly from their godly example.

Then, the verse continues, "and when the wicked perish, there is shouting." This is not a call for human malice or gleeful vengeance, but a profound statement about divine justice. Wickedness, by its very nature, brings corruption, oppression, suffering, and decay. When those who actively oppose God's ways and inflict harm upon others are removed from positions of influence or are brought to justice, there is a natural and righteous "shouting" of relief. This rejoicing is for the liberation from evil, the restoration of order, and the triumph of God’s perfect justice. It signifies the end of injustice, the cessation of cruelty, and the hope for a better, more godly future. Ultimately, this points to a day when Christ will return, and all wickedness will be banished from His Kingdom, bringing eternal peace and everlasting joy to His saints.

As believers, let us strive to be the righteous whose lives bring joy and blessing to our communities, and let us ever trust in the perfect, sovereign justice of our Almighty God.

Lord, help us to live righteously through Christ, being a blessing to all around us, and to rest in Your perfect, ultimate justice.
