# The Enduring Choice: Wisdom or Perversity

"A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised." (Proverbs 12:8, KJV)

The book of Proverbs, inspired by God, is a treasury of divine wisdom, offering timeless truths for righteous living. Today's verse from Proverbs 12:8 presents a stark contrast, laying before us two distinct paths and their inevitable outcomes. It speaks to the core of our character, reminding us that our internal disposition ultimately dictates our external commendation or condemnation.

First, consider the man who is "commended according to his wisdom." Biblical wisdom is far more than mere intellectual knowledge or worldly shrewdness. It is the practical application of God's truth to everyday life, rooted in the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 9:10). A wise man discerns God's will, lives by His precepts, speaks truth, and walks in integrity. He understands that true wisdom comes from above, generously given to those who ask in faith (James 1:5). Such a man seeks to honor God in his thoughts, words, and deeds. The commendation he receives is not necessarily worldly fame or fleeting accolades, but rather the genuine respect of God-fearing men, a clear conscience, and, most importantly, the favor of God Himself. His life bears good fruit—peace, stability, and a testimony that glorifies the Father. He builds a life of purpose and lasting value, knowing that his ultimate reward is with Christ.

In sharp contrast stands "he that is of a perverse heart." The word "perverse" describes something twisted, crooked, or morally depraved. A perverse heart is one that willingly deviates from God's righteous path, choosing rebellion over obedience, darkness over light. It is characterized by stubbornness, deceit, selfishness, and a persistent disregard for divine truth. Such an individual may temporarily prosper or gain worldly advantage, but their internal corruption ultimately leads to ruin. This perversity is not merely an occasional failing, but a settled disposition that actively resists God's ways. Consequently, the one with a perverse heart shall be "despised." This despising comes from God, who abhors evil, and eventually from righteous individuals who recognize the insincerity and corruption. Furthermore, the natural consequences of such a life—broken relationships, shame, sorrow, and spiritual emptiness—are a form of contempt. His legacy is one of regret, and his end is without true hope.

Proverbs 12:8 serves as a powerful call to examine our own hearts. Are we diligently seeking wisdom from God's Word and through His Spirit, allowing it to shape our lives? Or are we permitting a spirit of perversity to take root, twisting our desires away from righteousness? There is no middle ground in this choice. Let us choose wisdom, that we might live lives that are commendable in the eyes of God and man.

Lord, grant us hearts that hunger for Your wisdom and courage to walk in Your righteous ways, guarding us from all perversity. Amen.
