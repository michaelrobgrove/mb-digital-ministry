# Forsake the Foolish, Embrace Understanding

Proverbs 9:6 offers a profound and direct command from God’s wisdom: "Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding." This is more than mere good advice; it is a divine imperative, a clear pathway for believers seeking to honor God and live a life of true purpose.

The initial charge, "Forsake the foolish," calls for decisive separation. Biblically, "foolish" describes those who reject God’s wisdom, scorn His commands, and live by sinful, worldly principles. It encompasses lifestyles and attitudes directly contrary to God’s Word. To "forsake" means actively abandoning, turning from, and severing ties with anything leading us from Christ—ungodly influences, sinful habits, worldly entertainment, and ungodly associations. This is a call to repentance, a radical turning from sin to righteousness.

The promise attached to this forsaking is astounding: "and live." This signifies not just physical existence, but a deeper, spiritual life. It is the abundant life Jesus promised (John 10:10), characterized by peace, joy, and purpose found only in Him. It is life lived in fellowship with our Creator, a foretaste of eternal life for those who trust in Christ’s finished work. To truly live, we must first die to self and the world’s empty allurements.

Following this turning, we are instructed to "go in the way of understanding." This is the positive counterpoint. Understanding, in God's eyes, is divine wisdom—knowing God's truth and applying it. It is found in the King James Bible, through diligent study, fervent prayer, and humble submission to the Holy Spirit. To walk this way means actively pursuing godliness, seeking sound doctrine, and making daily choices aligning with our Lord's character. It is a journey of continuous growth, seeking to know Christ intimately and walk closely in His footsteps.

Brothers and sisters, the choice is clear and daily before us. Will we cling to the fading glories and deceitful promises of this world, or bravely forsake the foolish and embrace the life-giving understanding God Himself provides? Let us choose wisely, for our very lives, both temporal and eternal, depend on it.

Lord, help us to forsake all foolishness and diligently walk in Your divine way of understanding each day.
