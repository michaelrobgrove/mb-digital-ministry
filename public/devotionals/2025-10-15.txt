# The Tale of Two Influences: Scorn vs. Wisdom

Our King James Bible, in Proverbs 29:8, presents a powerful and timely contrast that speaks volumes about the impact individuals have on their communities: "Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath." This single verse lays before us two distinct paths of influence and their inevitable outcomes.

First, let us consider the "scornful men." Who are they? They are those who mock, ridicule, and show contempt for God's ways, His truth, and even His people. They often harbor pride in their hearts, dismissing righteousness as old-fashioned and scoffing at biblical principles. Their speech is divisive, their attitudes critical, and their hearts hardened against spiritual instruction. When such men hold sway, they inevitably "bring a city into a snare." A "snare" is a trap, a dangerous situation from which escape is difficult. Scornful attitudes, when unchecked, erode moral foundations, promote lawlessness, and sow seeds of discord within families, churches, and entire communities. They lead people astray, normalizing sin and creating an environment ripe for spiritual and social decay, ultimately inviting God's just displeasure.

In stark contrast, the verse shines a light on "wise men." True biblical wisdom does not originate from worldly intellect or cunning, but from the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 9:10). These are individuals who honor God's Word, seek His counsel, and walk in obedience to His commandments. They are humble, peace-loving, and committed to righteousness. The influence of such men is transformative: they "turn away wrath." This means they prevent conflict, soothe troubled spirits, offer sound counsel rooted in Scripture, and stand as intercessors and examples of God's grace. Their godly lives and words can de-escalate tensions, promote reconciliation, and lead a community back to paths of righteousness, thereby averting the consequences of sin and inviting God's blessing and mercy.

This proverb calls each of us to examine our own hearts and our influence. Are we contributors to a "snare," or are we instruments for "turning away wrath"? In a world increasingly filled with scorn and division, the call for wise, God-fearing men and women is more urgent than ever. Let us commit to seeking the Lord's wisdom daily, speaking truth in love, and living lives that reflect His righteousness, thereby becoming a beacon of hope and peace in our homes, churches, and communities.

Lord, grant us the wisdom to live righteously and be instruments of Your peace in a world desperately needing Your truth.
