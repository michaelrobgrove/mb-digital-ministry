# Fleeing the Snares of Sin

Proverbs 6:5 gives us a powerful and urgent command: "Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler." This vivid imagery calls to mind a helpless animal caught in a life-threatening situation, with a predator closing in. The message is clear: escape, and do so with the utmost speed and determination.

While the immediate context of this verse in Proverbs 6 refers to the perilous trap of co-signing a debt for another, the principle extends far beyond financial entanglements. The Spirit of God, through Solomon, is urging us to recognize danger and flee from it. Spiritually, we are often like the vulnerable roe or bird, and the hunter or fowler is none other than our adversary, the devil, who "walketh about, seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8). Satan is a master fowler, setting subtle snares of sin, temptation, and worldly compromise to ensnare and destroy our souls. He makes sin look appealing, offering temporary pleasure while concealing the hooks of eternal regret and separation from God.

The command "Deliver thyself" is a call to immediate, decisive action. It does not suggest that we save ourselves from eternal damnation – that salvation is solely by God's grace through faith in Christ Jesus. Rather, it speaks to our responsibility in wisdom and sanctification. When we discern a spiritual trap – be it a tempting thought, a compromising situation, a questionable friendship, or a habit that pulls us away from God – we are not to linger. We are not to rationalize, negotiate, or delay. Just as a deer bolts from the sound of a hunter, or a bird struggles fiercely to escape a net, we must flee from sin with the same urgency. "Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart" (2 Timothy 2:22).

This urgent escape isn't done in our own strength, but by relying on the power of the Holy Spirit and the wisdom of God's Word. God always provides a way of escape from temptation (1 Corinthians 10:13). Our part is to recognize the danger, cry out to God for strength, and then actively take the path of deliverance He provides. Fleeing from sin means turning to Christ, embracing His righteousness, and seeking His cleansing. It means breaking off entanglements, making hard choices, and prioritizing our walk with God above all else. Let us be wise, discern the fowler's snares, and with holy haste, deliver ourselves into the safety of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Heavenly Father, grant us the spiritual discernment to recognize the snares of sin and the urgent grace to flee from them into the refuge of Your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.
