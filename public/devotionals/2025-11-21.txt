# The Unwavering Strength of God's People

Proverbs 30:30 (KJV) presents a powerful image: "A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any." This verse, nestled in the wisdom literature of Scripture, calls us to reflect on an attribute vital for the believer: unyielding strength and unwavering resolve.

The lion, king of the jungle, is a creature of immense power and courage. It faces its challenges head-on, unconcerned by the strength or number of its adversaries. It "turneth not away for any." This characteristic speaks volumes about steadfastness, bravery, and absolute conviction.

As Southern and Independent Baptists, we immediately recognize the ultimate embodiment of this strength in our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (Revelation 5:5), mighty in power, sovereign over all creation, and steadfast in His purpose. From His birth to His agonizing journey to the cross, Jesus never turned away. He faced the scorn of men, the temptations of Satan, and the ultimate sacrifice for our sins, all without flinching. His love, His truth, and His mission were unwavering. He is the strongest among all, and He turns not away from His redemptive plan for humanity.

This verse also serves as a profound challenge and encouragement for every believer. In a world that constantly pressures us to compromise our faith, dilute our convictions, or shrink from sharing the Gospel, we are called to exhibit a similar resolve. We are not to be easily swayed by popular opinion, cultural currents, or the fear of man. Like the lion, we are to stand firm on the unchangeable Word of God, not turning away from biblical truth for convenience, comfort, or acceptance.

Drawing our strength from Christ, we are empowered to live lives that reflect His unwavering character. We are to be steadfast in our witness, resolute in our obedience, and courageous in the face of adversity. When temptations arise, when trials press in, or when the world seeks to silence our faith, let us remember the Lion of Judah, who never turns away, and find in Him the strength to stand firm.

May we, by God's grace, demonstrate such unwavering strength in our faith walk.

Lord, grant us the strength and courage to stand firm in Your truth, turning not away from Your will for any reason, all for Your glory. Amen.
