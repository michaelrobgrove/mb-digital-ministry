# The Wisdom of Restrained Speech

Proverbs 17:27 (KJV) offers profound insight into the character of a truly wise individual: "He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit." In an age saturated with constant communication and an often-unrestrained flow of opinions, this verse calls us back to a vital, God-honoring principle: the power and beauty of thoughtful, disciplined speech, rooted in genuine understanding.

The first part of the verse tells us, "He that hath knowledge spareth his words." This is not an admonition to silence, but rather an encouragement to *discernment* in our speech. A truly knowledgeable person, one who has diligently studied God's Word and sought His wisdom, does not feel the need to fill every silence or offer an opinion on every subject. Instead, they weigh their words carefully, considering their impact, truthfulness, and necessity. Idle chatter, gossip, hasty judgments, and rash promises often flow from a lack of true knowledge or self-control. The wise Christian understands that "in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin" (Proverbs 10:19), and therefore, chooses their words with purpose, speaking only what is edifying, true, and glorifying to God. Our speech reflects the depth of our walk with the Lord.

Building on this, the proverb states, "and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit." This "excellent spirit" is not born of arrogance or self-importance, but rather from a deep, spiritual understanding that comes from God. It's a spirit marked by calmness, patience, humility, and peace. A person of understanding grasps the bigger picture, recognizing God's sovereignty and His working in all circumstances. This understanding keeps their spirit from being easily ruffled by every wind of doctrine or every challenging situation. They possess a settled assurance that allows them to remain gracious and level-headed, even amidst trials or disagreements. Such a spirit is a beautiful testimony to the transforming power of Christ within.

As Southern and Independent Baptists, we hold high the authority of God's Word as the source of all true knowledge and understanding. Let us strive to be men and women who immerse ourselves in scripture, allowing it to cultivate both disciplined speech and an excellent spirit within us. May our lives, and especially our words, reflect the wisdom of our Lord.

Lord, grant us the grace to spare our words wisely and to cultivate an understanding heart that glorifies You in all things.
