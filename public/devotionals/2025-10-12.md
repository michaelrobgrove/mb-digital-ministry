# The Harvest of Our Lives: Words and Deeds

Our wisdom for today comes from the ancient, divinely inspired book of Proverbs, a rich source of practical guidance for godly living. Proverbs 12:14 declares, "A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompense of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him." This verse presents us with a dual truth concerning the consequences of our communication and our conduct, a profound principle established by our sovereign God.

First, consider "the fruit of his mouth." Our words are powerful instruments, possessing the capacity to build up or tear down, to bless or to curse, to spread truth or to propagate deceit. When a believer allows the Holy Spirit to guide their speech, choosing words of encouragement, honesty, love, and the Gospel message, they will indeed be "satisfied with good." This satisfaction comes in many forms: peaceful relationships, a clear conscience, the joy of edifying others, and most importantly, glorifying our Lord. Our witness for Christ is often profoundly conveyed through what we say. Do our words reflect the character of Christ, or do they betray a worldly spirit? Let us strive to speak words that are seasoned with grace, always pointing to the hope we have in Jesus.

Secondly, the verse reminds us that "the recompense of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him." This is the unchanging principle of sowing and reaping, a fundamental truth that holds sway over all our actions. Our deeds, our labor, our service – whether seen or unseen – will inevitably bear consequences. If we labor diligently for the Lord, serving Him with faithful hands, striving for righteousness, and living according to His commands, we can expect God's favor and blessing. While salvation is by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9), our lives as believers should naturally produce good works as an outflow of a transformed heart (Ephesians 2:10). These works are not to earn our salvation, but are evidence of it, and they will be rewarded by our Heavenly Father. Conversely, unrighteous deeds will yield their own bitter fruit.

Proverbs 12:14 calls us to a life of intentionality in both our speech and our service. It encourages us to examine our daily lives: are our words and our actions bringing glory to God? Are they producing good fruit, leading to satisfaction and blessing, or are they sowing seeds of regret and shame? May we ever seek to live lives that honor Him in every utterance and every endeavor, knowing that our Father sees all and will render to each according to His perfect justice and grace.

May our words and our works always honor You, Lord, bearing good fruit for Your glory. Amen.
