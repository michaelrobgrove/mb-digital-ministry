# The Upright's Highway

Proverbs 16:17 (KJV) lays before us a profound truth concerning the believer's walk: "The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul." This verse paints a vivid picture of the distinct path God has set for those who are called by His name. It's not a winding, ambiguous trail, but a clearly marked "highway"—a main road intended for direct passage.

To be "upright" in God's sight means to be justified by faith in Jesus Christ, and subsequently, to strive to live in a manner that reflects that new nature. Our uprightness isn't earned by our works, but is a gift through His grace. However, once we are made upright, our lives are meant to demonstrate a change. The very definition of this spiritual highway is "to depart from evil." This isn't a passive avoidance, but an active, intentional turning away. It means identifying sinful thoughts, words, and actions, and purposefully choosing the opposite—the path of righteousness. It's renouncing the allure of the world, fleshly desires, and the schemes of the devil, just as we are taught throughout Scripture.

This departure from evil requires diligence, which leads us to the second part of the verse: "he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul." "Keeping his way" implies a continuous, watchful effort. It's not enough to depart from evil once; we must consistently guard our hearts and minds. This involves daily communion with God through prayer, immersing ourselves in His Holy Word, and seeking fellowship with other believers who will encourage us in righteousness. Just as a driver must stay vigilant to remain on the highway, so too must the believer remain watchful to stay on the path God has ordained.

The blessed consequence of this consistent obedience is that he "preserveth his soul." This does not mean we earn our salvation, for that is a free gift of grace. Rather, it means we guard our spiritual vitality, our peace, and our testimony. By clinging to God's path, we protect ourselves from the devastating consequences of sin—the broken fellowship, the guilt, the shame, and the spiritual barrenness that evil inevitably brings. We preserve our walk, our usefulness to God, and our joy in Him, ensuring that our lives are a continual witness to His transforming power.

Let us commit today to staying on this clear highway, actively departing from every form of evil, and diligently keeping our way, that our souls may thrive in the Lord.

Heavenly Father, empower us by Your Spirit to depart from evil and diligently keep Your way, that our lives may ever bring You glory.
