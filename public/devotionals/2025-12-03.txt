# Receiving Wisdom's Call

Proverbs, a book brimming with divine insight, often presents stark contrasts between wisdom and folly. Today's verse, Proverbs 9:9, offers a profound truth about the nature of genuine wisdom and righteousness: "Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning." This verse isn't merely an observation; it's an invitation and a description of the Spirit-led life.

Consider first the "wise man." In God's economy, true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 9:10). It's not intellectual prowess alone, but a humble heart receptive to divine truth. A truly wise individual understands the vastness of God's knowledge and their own finite understanding. Therefore, when instruction is offered, they don't recoil in pride, thinking they know enough. Instead, they eagerly receive it, allowing it to deepen their understanding and sharpen their walk. This isn't about being told what they already know; it's about discerning new applications, gaining deeper spiritual insight, and growing in the practical outworking of their faith. Their wisdom isn't stagnant; it's dynamic, ever-expanding under the influence of God's Word.

Similarly, the "just man" — one who has been declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ — will "increase in learning." Justification is a singular act, but sanctification is a lifelong process. A truly redeemed heart yearns for more of God, more holiness, more understanding of His will. This "learning" isn't confined to academic study; it's the Holy Spirit illuminating scripture, the pastor's sermon clarifying truth, or the counsel of a godly mentor providing direction. It's the daily submission to the Lordship of Christ that transforms our character, aligning it more perfectly with His. The just man doesn't merely *know* truth; he *applies* it, allowing it to refine his thoughts, words, and deeds.

This verse challenges us, dear believer. Are we truly "wise" and "just" in the biblical sense? If so, we should exhibit a hunger for God's instruction. Do we regularly open our Bibles, attend church faithfully, and seek out spiritual growth opportunities? Or do we, like the fool, think we have learned enough, shutting ourselves off from the very instruction that leads to deeper wisdom and increased godliness? Let us cultivate a spirit of humility, eagerly receiving the unchanging truth of God's Word, knowing that in doing so, we will indeed grow wiser and increase in learning, to the glory of our Lord.

*Heavenly Father, we pray for humble hearts, ever eager to receive Your divine instruction, that we may grow daily in wisdom and righteousness, reflecting more of Your Son, Jesus Christ.*
