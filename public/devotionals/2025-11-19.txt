# The Blessing of Humility Over Empty Pride

Today's verse from Proverbs 12:9 (KJV) presents a stark and profound contrast: "He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread." At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive to a world that often equates honor with success and despises those without public acclaim. Yet, the wisdom of Godâ€™s Word shines through, revealing a divine perspective on true worth and provision.

Consider "he that is despised, and hath a servant." This individual may not be held in high esteem by society. Perhaps he is overlooked, misunderstood, or even scorned. He doesn't seek the limelight or demand attention. Yet, the proverb states he "hath a servant," implying that despite human disdain, God has provided for his needs, granting him a measure of blessing and practical capacity. His quiet life, perhaps unnoticed by the world, is sustained by divine grace. His worth is not derived from human opinion or public accolades, but from God's steadfast care and the humble character he embodies. True blessing often flourishes in the fertile ground of humility, far from the spotlight of human praise.

Now, juxtapose this with "he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread." This is the proud man. He parades his self-importance, puffs himself up with vanity, and craves the admiration of others. He demands recognition and believes he is deserving of the best. Yet, despite his self-exaltation and perhaps his outward show, he "lacketh bread." This phrase signifies a fundamental lack, a spiritual or even physical destitution that pride ultimately brings. His self-honor is an empty shell, devoid of true substance and God's sustaining hand. Pride, a sin that grieves God, closes the door to His grace and often leads to isolation and want.

This proverb reminds us of a fundamental truth: God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). Worldly honor is fleeting and often hollow. True blessedness comes not from self-promotion or the approval of man, but from a humble heart that trusts in God alone. The despised, who live by God's provision, are far richer than the self-exalting who starve on the empty calories of their own inflated ego.

As believers, we understand that our value comes from being created in God's image and redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ, not from our own works or reputation. Let us therefore strive to walk in humility, recognizing our complete dependence on the Lord, and trusting Him to provide for all our needs according to His glorious riches.

Lord, help us to humble ourselves before You, to forsake all pride, and to trust solely in Your abundant provision and grace.
