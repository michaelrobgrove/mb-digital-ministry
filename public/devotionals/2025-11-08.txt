# A Gentle Tongue: A Biblical Response to Wrath

"A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger." (Proverbs 15:1, KJV)

In a world often filled with sharp words, heated debates, and quick tempers, the wisdom of Proverbs stands as a timeless beacon for the child of God. Today's verse from King Solomon offers profound insight into the power of our speech and its direct impact on our relationships and environments. It presents a stark contrast: the calming effect of a soft answer versus the inflammatory nature of grievous words.

Consider first the "soft answer." This is not an answer given in weakness or cowardice, but one rooted in humility, wisdom, and the self-control gifted by the Holy Spirit. When we are confronted with anger, accusation, or disagreement, our natural inclination might be to respond in kind, to defend ourselves aggressively, or to escalate the conflict. However, God's Word calls us to a higher standard. A soft answer is a deliberate choice to de-escalate, to listen with an open heart, and to speak with gentleness, even when we feel unjustly attacked. It means choosing words that aim to understand, to soothe, and to bring peace, rather than to provoke or retaliate. Such a response reflects the character of Christ, who, "when he was reviled, reviled not again" (1 Peter 2:23). It requires prayerful discernment and a willingness to put the other person's peace above our own pride.

Conversely, "grievous words stir up anger." Grievous words are harsh, cutting, sarcastic, proud, or unloving. They are words spoken without thought for their impact, often fueled by our own frustration, irritation, or sense of self-righteousness. Such words act like fuel to a fire, igniting passions, deepening resentments, and widening divides. They tear down rather than build up, and they grieve the Holy Spirit who dwells within us. The Bible warns us repeatedly about the power of the tongue (James 3:5-6), reminding us that it can be a source of both blessing and cursing.

As believers, we are called to be peacemakers (Matthew 5:9) and to let our speech always be "with grace, seasoned with salt" (Colossians 4:6). This verse challenges us to examine our communication patterns. Do our words bring peace or contention? Do we seek to calm troubled waters or to stir them up? Let us strive, by God's grace, to cultivate a gentle tongue, remembering that a soft answer is not just good relational advice, but a powerful witness to the transforming power of Christ in our lives.

Heavenly Father, grant us the wisdom and self-control to always speak soft answers that turn away wrath, bringing glory to Your name. Amen.
