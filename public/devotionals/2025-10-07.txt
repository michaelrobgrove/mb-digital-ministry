# The Feast of Wisdom

In Proverbs chapter 9, Wisdom is personified, depicted as a gracious hostess who has built her house, hewn out her seven pillars, prepared a magnificent feast, and sent forth her maidens to issue an urgent invitation. Our verse for today, Proverbs 9:5, is the heart of that invitation: "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled." This is not merely an offer of earthly food; it is a profound call to partake in spiritual nourishment that leads to true life and understanding.

The simple word "Come" is an active invitation from God Himself, extended through His divine Wisdom. It is a loving summons, not a forceful command. Just as a good host desires their guests to be fed and satisfied, so our Heavenly Father desires to fill us with His truth and wisdom. This invitation resonates with the gospel call to salvation â€“ "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28). But it also extends to our daily walk as believers. It is an ongoing invitation to draw near, to seek His face, and to abide in His presence, receiving spiritual sustenance for every aspect of our lives.

What is this "bread" and "wine" that Wisdom offers? It represents the abundant and perfect provision of God's truth. The "bread" speaks of essential nourishment, just as Jesus declared Himself to be the "Bread of Life" (John 6:35), satisfying our deepest hunger. The "wine which I have mingled" speaks of something carefully prepared, a perfect blend of truth, knowledge, and discernment, perfectly suited to refresh and strengthen our souls. It is not just raw ingredients but a thoughtfully prepared feast, indicating that God's wisdom is complete, sufficient, and perfectly tailored for our spiritual growth. When we partake of God's Word, we are truly eating of this bread and drinking of this mingled wine, receiving the pure and unadulterated truth that fortifies us against the deceptions of the world.

To accept this invitation requires a deliberate choice. We must turn away from the empty offerings of the world and choose to sit at Wisdom's table. This means actively engaging with God's Word, seeking His guidance through prayer, and allowing the Holy Spirit to transform our minds. When we partake of this divine provision, we gain spiritual strength, clarity, and the discernment needed to navigate life's challenges. May we not neglect this gracious invitation, but daily "come" and feast upon the life-giving wisdom that God so freely offers.

Heavenly Father, help us to always accept Your gracious invitation, feeding daily on Your spiritual bread and drinking deeply of Your mingled wisdom. Amen.
