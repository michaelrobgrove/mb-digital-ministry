# Let Not Thine Heart Envy Sinners

In a world that often celebrates worldly success, power, and pleasure, it can be easy for our hearts to wander, comparing our walk of faith to the seemingly unhindered lives of those who live without regard for God. Our scripture for today, Proverbs 23:17, delivers a profound warning and a crucial redirection: "Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long."

The temptation to envy sinners is as old as humanity itself. We see their lavish lifestyles, their apparent freedom from consequences, their accumulation of wealth, or their worldly acclaim, and a seed of discontentment can begin to sprout in our hearts. Why do they prosper while we strive to live righteously, sometimes facing challenges and sacrifices? The Bible frequently reminds us that the prosperity of the wicked is fleeting, a temporary mirage that ultimately leads to destruction. Their pleasures are momentary, their gains are temporal, and their end is a fearful judgment. To envy them is to value the fleeting pleasures of this world over the eternal treasures promised to those who faithfully follow Christ. It's a dangerous deception that distracts us from what truly matters.

Instead of looking sideways with envy, the wise man redirects our gaze upwards and inwards: "but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long." This "fear of the LORD" is not a cowering dread, but a reverential awe, a profound respect, and a deep submission to the Almighty God. It is an acknowledgment of His absolute sovereignty, His perfect holiness, His righteous judgment, and His boundless love. When we truly fear the Lord, our perspective shifts. We understand that His ways are higher than our ways, and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts. Our focus moves from earthly comparisons to heavenly aspirations, from temporal gains to eternal rewards.

To live "in the fear of the LORD all the day long" means that this reverence, this awe, and this commitment to obey Him is not a Sunday morning ritual, but a constant, abiding posture of our heart. It informs every decision, every thought, every word, and every action, from the moment we wake until we lay our heads down to sleep. It means trusting His plan even when we don't understand it, clinging to His promises when the world offers tempting alternatives, and striving for holiness because He is holy. When we prioritize God's will and His glory above all else, the fleeting allure of the world and the empty prosperity of sinners lose their power to ensnare our hearts. Our joy becomes rooted in Christ, our hope in His return, and our satisfaction in His presence.

Let us, therefore, resolve today to guard our hearts against the subtle poison of envy, and instead, cultivate a deep, abiding, all-consuming fear of the Lord, trusting in His perfect wisdom and His unfailing righteousness.

*Heavenly Father, help us to fix our eyes upon You, to walk in reverent fear of Your holy name all the day long, and to resist the temptation to envy the temporary gains of this world.*
