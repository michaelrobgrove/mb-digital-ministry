# A Reflection on Proverbs 28:25

Proverbs 28:25 (KJV) presents a powerful contrast that challenges our hearts and points us toward true blessedness: "He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat." This verse lays before us two distinct paths with vastly different outcomes.

First, we see the path of the "proud heart." A proud heart is one that is centered on self, relying on its own wisdom, strength, and resources rather than acknowledging God's sovereignty. It puffs itself up, believes it knows best, and often looks down on others. What does such a heart produce? The scripture says it "stirreth up strife." Pride is a root cause of division, arguments, bitterness, and conflict in families, churches, and communities. When we are proud, we are quick to defend ourselves, slow to forgive, and eager to assert our own will. This spirit opposes unity and peace, creating a tumultuous environment wherever it thrives. It was pride that led to Satan's fall, and it continues to be a great stumbling block for mankind, separating us from God and from one another.

In stark contrast, the verse presents the one "that putteth his trust in the LORD." This is a heart that humbles itself, recognizing its dependence on the Almighty God. To trust the Lord means to surrender our plans, anxieties, and desires to His perfect will, believing in His goodness, wisdom, and power. It is a daily decision to lean not on our own understanding, but in all our ways to acknowledge Him (Proverbs 3:5-6).

What is the promise for such a trusting heart? "Shall be made fat." This phrase, in biblical context, does not refer to physical weight but to spiritual and material abundance, blessing, and robust health. It signifies a soul that is well-nourished, content, prosperous in God's favor, and richly provided for by Him. Instead of the strife and emptiness that pride brings, trust in the Lord brings peace, contentment, and a life that flourishes under God's watchful care. He ensures our needs are met, our souls are satisfied, and our lives are full of His goodness, even amidst earthly challenges. We are "made fat" in His grace, mercy, and enduring love.

Let us examine our hearts today. Are we allowing pride to stir up strife in our lives and relationships, or are we actively choosing to put our complete trust in the Lord? Only through trusting Him can we experience the true spiritual richness and peace that He promises.

Lord, help us to humble our proud hearts, to put our complete trust in You, and to walk in the abundant peace and provision that only You can give. Amen.
