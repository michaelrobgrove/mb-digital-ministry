# The Power of the Tongue: Wisdom vs. Foolishness

"The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness." (Proverbs 15:2)

Our words are powerful. They can build up or tear down, bring comfort or cause pain, share truth or spread deceit. This verse from Proverbs vividly contrasts two types of speech, revealing the heart from which they spring. It calls us to consider how we use the mighty instrument of our tongue.

First, we see the "tongue of the wise." This individual doesn't merely possess knowledge; they "useth knowledge aright." True wisdom isn't just about accumulating facts, but about discerning how to apply those facts in a godly and beneficial way. When a wise person speaks, their words are measured, seasoned with grace, and rooted in biblical truth. They are thoughtful, not impulsive. They seek to edify, to encourage, to instruct, and to share the Gospel with clarity and conviction. Their speech reflects a heart that is submitted to God, guided by His Spirit, and focused on His glory. They understand that every word spoken has an impact, and they desire that impact to be positive and God-honoring.

In stark contrast, "the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness." This image suggests an uncontrolled, abundant, and thoughtless outpouring. A fool's speech is often rash, impulsive, and devoid of spiritual discernment. It might be filled with idle gossip, bitter complaints, harsh criticism, or worldly chatter that profanes the name of Christ. There is no filter, no consideration for the consequences, and certainly no attempt to glorify God. Such speech often leaves a trail of confusion, division, and discouragement. It reveals a heart that is not disciplined, not yielded to the Lord, and not seeking to walk in His ways.

As believers, we are called to be wise, not foolish. We are to be imitators of Christ, and His words were always full of grace and truth. Let us prayerfully examine our own speech. Do our words reflect the wisdom that comes from above, or the foolishness of the world? Do we thoughtfully apply God's Word to our conversations, or do we thoughtlessly spill out whatever comes to mind? Let us guard our tongues, understanding that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh (Matthew 12:34). May our speech always be a testimony to the transforming power of Jesus Christ in our lives.

Lord, help us to use our tongues to speak wisdom, truth, and grace, always for Your glory and the edification of others.
