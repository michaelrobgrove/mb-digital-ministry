# Keeping Your Mouth, Keeping Your Life

The book of Proverbs is a treasury of divine wisdom, offering practical guidance for daily living. Today’s verse, Proverbs 13:3, delivers a profound truth with stark clarity: "He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction." This scripture calls us to consider the immense power held within our words and the eternal consequences of how we choose to wield them.

To "keep his mouth" means to exercise disciplined self-control over our speech. It speaks of a deliberate, thoughtful approach to communication, reflecting the wisdom that comes from God. It is the practice of thinking before we speak, discerning when silence is more golden than speech, and ensuring our words are edifying, truthful, and necessary. The wise believer understands that not every thought needs to be voiced, not every opinion needs to be shared, and not every comment needs to be made. By holding our tongues, by refraining from gossip, slander, foolish boasting, or impulsive criticism, we safeguard our character, protect our relationships, and preserve our peace. Indeed, a controlled tongue often leads to a life free from unnecessary strife, misunderstanding, and regret, allowing us to walk in greater favor with God and man.

Conversely, the verse warns against "he that openeth wide his lips," portraying someone who speaks carelessly, thoughtlessly, and without restraint. This is the individual prone to impulsivity, whose words often precede their wisdom. Such unbridled speech can manifest as angry outbursts, destructive gossip, thoughtless jokes that wound, or proud declarations that lead to humiliation. The consequence, as the Scripture declares, is "destruction." This destruction may not always be a literal physical end, but it certainly encompasses the ruin of reputations, the fracturing of friendships, the loss of trust, the erosion of spiritual influence, and even financial or legal troubles. James 3:6 reminds us that the tongue "is a fire, a world of iniquity...it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."

As born-again believers, we are called to reflect the character of Christ in all areas of our lives, especially in our speech. Our words are powerful tools, capable of building up or tearing down, of blessing or cursing. Let us, therefore, earnestly pray for the Holy Spirit’s guidance in taming our tongues. Let us cultivate hearts that are pure and minds that are submitted to God’s will, knowing that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (Matthew 12:34). May our speech always bring glory to God and be a testament to His transforming power in our lives.

Lord, help us to keep our mouths, that we may keep our lives, speaking only words that honor You and bless others.
