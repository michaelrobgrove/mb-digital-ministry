# The Harvest of Our Words

Proverbs 13:2 presents us with a profound contrast, a divine principle that echoes throughout Scripture: "A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence." This verse, as clear and sharp as a surgeon's scalpel, lays bare the direct relationship between what we say and the life we experience.

Consider first the blessed promise: "A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth." What is this "fruit"? It is the harvest of our words. When our speech is seasoned with grace (Colossians 4:6), when it builds up rather than tears down (Ephesians 4:29), when it speaks truth in love, encourages the faint-hearted, and shares the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, then we are sowing seeds of goodness. The "good" we eat is not merely external prosperity, but often refers to inner peace, harmonious relationships, a clear conscience, the blessing of God upon our endeavors, and the spiritual nourishment that comes from a life aligned with His will. Our words, springing from a heart dedicated to the Lord, become instruments of God's grace, drawing others to Him and enriching our own spiritual walk. A believer’s mouth should be a fountain of life, a wellspring of wisdom that brings forth pleasant and profitable things.

However, the verse sharply pivots to a sobering warning: "but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence." A transgressor is one who willfully disobeys God’s commands, whose life and language are contrary to divine truth. The "violence" they eat is not always physical harm, but a profound spiritual and emotional turmoil. It is the chaos, strife, bitterness, and destruction that are the inevitable harvest of ungodly speech and a rebellious heart. Gossip, slander, lies, boastful pride, and words born of anger or hatred, all sow seeds of discord. The "soul" eating violence signifies a deep, internal suffering – a troubled conscience, fractured relationships, spiritual emptiness, and the just judgment of God. Their own words, deeds, and a life lived apart from Christ become the very instruments of their undoing, filling their existence with conflict and distress.

This proverb calls every believer to a diligent examination of their speech. Are our words producing good fruit, or are they contributing to a harvest of violence, both for ourselves and others? As children of God, redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus, we are called to let our speech reflect the transformation within. May our mouths be used for His glory, proclaiming His truth, offering encouragement, and speaking life. For indeed, we shall eat good or violence, by the fruit of our mouth.

Lord, help us to guard our tongues and use our words to bring You glory and build up Your kingdom, so that we may eat good by the fruit of our mouths. Amen.
