# A Reflection on Proverbs 27:26

Our verse for today, Proverbs 27:26, offers a glimpse into ancient agricultural life, yet it holds timeless wisdom for our spiritual walk: "The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field." This verse, like much of the book of Proverbs, speaks to the practical realities of life, reminding us of the Lord's provision and our responsibility as stewards of His blessings.

Consider first, "The lambs are for thy clothing." Here, we see the most immediate and necessary provision. Lambs provide wool, which is spun into thread and woven into garments. This speaks to God’s care for our fundamental needs. He does not leave us without covering. Yet, it also speaks to our diligence. These lambs do not shear themselves; they require care, feeding, and tending. It is through diligent labor and wise management that one ensures clothing for the household. In our lives today, this principle remains true. God provides our daily bread, our homes, and our necessities, often through the work of our own hands and the honest labor He enables us to perform. We are called to be diligent, trusting that as we work faithfully, the Lord will supply for our needs. We ought to be content with what provides for our basic sustenance, giving thanks for the simple blessings that keep us.

Next, we read, "and the goats are the price of the field." This phrase suggests a different level of provision – one that involves future planning, investment, and the accumulation of assets for greater security or expansion. Goats, perhaps for their meat, milk, or skins, could be sold to purchase land. A field represented an inheritance, a means of further provision, and a foundation for future generations. This aspect of the verse teaches us the importance of wise stewardship beyond immediate needs. It encourages us to think ahead, to manage our resources prudently, and to understand the value of what God has entrusted to us. We are to work not only for today's necessities but also to wisely prepare for tomorrow's responsibilities, always remembering that all we possess ultimately belongs to God, and we are merely stewards.

In essence, Proverbs 27:26 calls us to a balanced life of practical diligence and forward-looking wisdom. It reminds us that God provides for our present needs (the clothing) and also gives us the means to secure our future (the field). May we ever be grateful for His provision and faithful in our stewardship of all He has given, whether great or small.

Lord, help us to be diligent in our labor and wise in our stewardship, trusting Your perfect provision for all our needs, both now and in the future. Amen.
