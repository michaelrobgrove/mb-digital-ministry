# Speaking with Wisdom and Kindness

Proverbs 31 presents us with the portrait of a truly virtuous woman, whose character serves as an aspiration for all believers, men and women alike, to reflect the heart of God. Today's verse, Proverbs 31:26, highlights two profound aspects of her communication: "She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness."

First, "She openeth her mouth with wisdom." This isn't merely about speaking frequently, but about speaking *rightly*. Her words are not impulsive or careless, but carefully chosen, informed by biblical truth and divine understanding. True wisdom, as scripture teaches, begins with the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 1:7). Her counsel is sound, her advice is righteous, and her every utterance seeks to uplift, instruct, and honor God. In a world full of idle chatter, gossip, and divisive rhetoric, the wise believer stands out by speaking words that bring clarity, peace, and spiritual insight. Do our words reflect the wisdom of God, or the fleeting trends of the world? Do we pause to pray and seek God's guidance before we speak?

Second, "and in her tongue is the law of kindness." This phrase suggests that kindness isn't an occasional act for her, but a governing principle, a fundamental rule that dictates every word she utters. Her speech is characterized by grace, gentleness, and compassion. She does not speak harshly, tear down, or spread malice. Instead, her words build up, encourage, and offer comfort. Just as the law of gravity governs the physical world, the "law of kindness" governs her tongue, ensuring that love and benevolence are always present. This kindness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22), cultivated through a close walk with Christ. It reflects the heart of our Savior, who always spoke truth with love.

For us, as followers of Jesus Christ, this verse is a powerful call to examine our own speech. Our words possess immense power â€“ power to wound or to heal, to destroy or to build up, to discourage or to inspire. Are our mouths opened with wisdom, rooted in God's Word and led by His Spirit? Is the law of kindness etched upon our tongues, guiding our every conversation? Let us strive to be intentional in our communication, seeking to glorify God in every word we speak. Let our speech be seasoned with grace, always pointing others to the Savior and reflecting His character to a lost and hurting world.

Heavenly Father, help us to open our mouths with Your wisdom and to always have the law of kindness upon our tongues, for Your glory and the blessing of others. Amen.
