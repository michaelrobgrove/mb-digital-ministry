# The Prowling Peril: Vigilance in a Tempting World

Proverbs 7:12 (KJV) states, "Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)"

This stark verse, part of a father's urgent warning to his son, paints a vivid picture of temptation personified by the "strange woman" or adulteress. But her actions extend far beyond the literal; she represents the seductive, ever-present nature of sin in a fallen world. The Spirit of God, through Solomon, reveals a critical truth about the spiritual dangers that surround us.

Consider her movements: "Now is she without, now in the streets." This speaks to sin’s public and pervasive nature. It isn't always hidden in dark alleys; often, it parades openly, dressed in garments of worldly appeal, promising pleasure, ease, or success. It walks boldly where many can see, becoming normalized and even celebrated in society. What was once scandalous is now often accepted, and what was once shameful is now flaunted. We, as born-again believers, must not be lulled into complacency by its public display.

Even more chilling is the phrase, "and lieth in wait at every corner." This reveals sin's aggressive, strategic, and opportunistic character. Temptation doesn't passively hope to be stumbled upon; it actively seeks to ensnare. It "lies in wait" – a predator stalking its prey. And it's "at every corner," meaning no place is entirely immune from its reach. Our workplaces, our entertainment, our social media feeds, even our quiet moments of reflection can become fertile ground for temptation if we are not spiritually alert.

For the follower of Christ, this verse is a clarion call to vigilance. We are called to live holy lives, set apart for God's glory, but the world, the flesh, and the devil constantly conspire to draw us away. The "strange woman" of Proverbs 7 represents any enticement that seeks to pull our hearts away from Christ and His righteous paths – be it lust, greed, pride, envy, or discontentment. These sins are not just abstract concepts; they manifest in concrete ways, "lying in wait" for us in our daily routines and decisions.

Therefore, we must walk circumspectly, "redeeming the time, because the days are evil" (Ephesians 5:16). This requires constant prayer, diligent study of God's Word to sharpen our discernment, and fellowship with other believers who can hold us accountable and encourage us. We must know the enemy's tactics, recognizing that temptation is shrewd and adaptable. Our only sure defense is to draw near to God, allowing His Holy Spirit to empower us to resist the lures of the world and walk in purity and obedience.

Let us be wise, not foolish, understanding that the enemy of our souls is always active, always seeking to devour. May we ever keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, and find our strength and refuge in Him alone.

Heavenly Father, grant us wisdom and discernment to recognize and resist the temptations that lie in wait at every corner, empowering us to walk in holiness and obedience for Your glory. Amen.
