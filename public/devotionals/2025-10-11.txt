# Known by Our Doings

Proverbs 20:11 (KJV) presents a profound truth about human nature and perception: "Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right." This verse reminds us that our actions, more than our words or intentions, are the true revealing agents of our character.

The wisdom of Solomon here highlights a principle that applies to all, from the youngest among us to the most seasoned saint. We may profess certain beliefs, speak of good intentions, or even claim a heart for God, but it is our "doings"—our consistent actions and choices—that ultimately make us "known." Just as a tree is known by its fruit, so too is a person known by their conduct. This isn't just about what we say we believe, but about how we live out those beliefs in our daily lives.

The verse then poses two critical questions about these doings: "whether his work be pure, and whether it be right." Purity speaks to the inner motive and integrity behind the action. Is the work untainted by selfishness, pride, or hypocrisy? Is it done with a sincere heart to please God? To be "right" means to conform to God's holy standard. Is the action morally sound, just, and in alignment with biblical truth? It's not enough for an action to *seem* good; it must stand up to the scrutiny of God's perfect law.

For the believer, this verse serves as a powerful call to self-examination and authentic living. As born-again children of God, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, we are called to live lives that reflect the transforming power of Christ. Our "doings" should be a clear testimony to the new creation we are in Him. When our works are pure and right, they bring glory to God, honor His name, and can draw others to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. If we claim Christ, yet our actions contradict His character, we bring reproach upon His name.

Let us prayerfully consider this timeless wisdom today. Let us strive, by the grace of God and the power of His Spirit, to live lives where our "doings" consistently reveal a pure heart and a walk that is right in His sight.

Lord, help us to live lives whose actions are pure and right, bringing glory to Your name and shining Your light in this world.
