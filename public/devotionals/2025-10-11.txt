# A Call to Wisdom's Table

Proverbs, the book of divine wisdom, often personifies wisdom as a gracious lady calling out to humanity. Our verse for today, Proverbs 9:16, captures her earnest invitation: "Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,"

Imagine Lady Wisdom, having prepared her feast of truth and understanding (Proverbs 9:1-5), now sending out her maidens to invite guests. She does not call the wise, the learned, or the self-sufficient. No, her special invitation is extended to two particular groups: "whoso is simple" and "him that wanteth understanding."

First, consider "whoso is simple." In the Biblical sense, "simple" does not necessarily mean unintelligent. Rather, it describes someone who is naive, easily swayed, lacking discernment, and often open to sin because they lack a firm foundation of truth. They are often uncritical, prone to error, and easily led astray by worldly philosophies or temptations. Many of us, in our natural state, are simple in this spiritual sense, lacking the divine wisdom needed to navigate life's complexities righteously. We are vulnerable without God's guidance.

Then, there is "him that wanteth understanding." This speaks of a soul that recognizes its own deficiency. It's a humble heart that acknowledges a lack of spiritual insight, a hunger for truth, and a desire to comprehend God's ways. This person isn't content to remain ignorant; they genuinely yearn to grasp the deeper realities of life, purpose, and eternity as revealed by God. They are not satisfied with superficial knowledge but long for discernment that comes only from above.

To both the simple and those wanting understanding, Wisdom issues a direct command: "let him turn in hither." This isn't a passive suggestion; it's an urgent call to action. "Hither" refers to her house, her feast â€“ her prepared bounty of truth and life. For us today, to turn in "hither" means to turn to the Word of God, to seek counsel from His Spirit, and ultimately, to embrace Jesus Christ, who is the very embodiment of God's wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:30). He is the fount from which all true understanding flows.

Finally, "she saith to him." Wisdom is not silent; she speaks. God is not distant; He communicates. Through His Word, through prayer, and through the fellowship of believers, His wisdom is made known to those who humbly seek it. Her voice calls us away from the dangers of spiritual naivety and towards the richness of a life lived in His truth.

Let us, therefore, heed Wisdom's call. If we recognize ourselves as simple, easily misled, or lacking spiritual understanding, let us not remain so. Let us turn from our own limited understanding and embrace the limitless wisdom offered by our gracious God.

*Our Heavenly Father, grant us humble hearts that recognize our need for Your divine wisdom, and give us ears to hear and obey Your gracious call.*
