# Doing Him Good: A Lifelong Commitment

"She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life." (Proverbs 31:12)

The book of Proverbs, particularly chapter 31, offers us a divine sketch of the virtuous woman. This isn't merely a cultural ideal from antiquity, but a timeless blueprint for godly character, established by God Himself. Our verse today zeroes in on a fundamental aspect of her nature: her unwavering commitment to her husband's well-being. "She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life."

Consider the profound simplicity and powerful depth of this statement. "Doing good" for her husband goes far beyond merely avoiding harm or conflict. It speaks to an active, intentional, and consistent pursuit of his welfare. It means she is his most ardent supporter, his trusted confidante, and his comforting presence. She speaks words of affirmation, she prays for his spiritual and physical health, she manages their household with wisdom, and she endeavors to lighten his burdens. Her actions, her words, and her very spirit are geared toward building him up and contributing to his success and peace, both at home and in his endeavors outside the home.

The contrast is equally important: "and not evil." This isn't just about refraining from malicious intent, but about guarding against anything that would undermine, dishonor, or distress him. This includes gossip, criticism, nagging, or an unsupportive spirit. The virtuous wife understands that her words and attitudes carry immense weight, and she chooses to use them to edify and uplift, never to tear down. Her commitment to "doing good" is a deliberate choice, reflecting her respect for her husband and her reverence for the Lord who established the marriage covenant.

Furthermore, this commitment endures "all the days of her life." This isn't a temporary phase or a fair-weather disposition. It is a steadfast, lifelong dedication that persists through trials, challenges, and changing seasons. It reflects a heart devoted to the Lord and to the sacred vows she has made. This kind of unwavering goodness is not born of human effort alone, but is a fruit of the Holy Spirit working within a yielded heart.

Sisters in Christ, as we reflect on this verse, let us be encouraged to cultivate a heart that actively seeks to do good for our husbands. Let us pray for the wisdom and strength to be such a blessing to our homes, fulfilling God's beautiful design for marriage.

Lord, empower us by Your Spirit to consistently do good and not evil for our husbands, all the days of our lives, for Your glory.
