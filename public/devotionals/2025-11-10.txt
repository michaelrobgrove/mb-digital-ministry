# Heeding God's Wisdom

Proverbs 5:1 begins with a tender yet authoritative address: "My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding." This is not merely a suggestion, but a profound invitation and a vital command from a loving Father—whether it's an earthly parent or our Heavenly Father—to His beloved child. It sets the stage for receiving divine counsel that is essential for a life of righteousness and peace.

The phrase "My son" immediately establishes a personal, intimate relationship. It speaks of care, concern, and a desire for our well-being. God, through the Holy Scriptures, speaks to us directly, wanting us to avoid the pitfalls and sorrows that come from foolish choices. He desires to guide us along the path of life, safeguarding us from the snares of this fallen world.

Next, we are told to "attend unto my wisdom." To "attend" means far more than simply hearing words; it means to give careful, focused attention, to heed with purpose, to let the words penetrate our hearts and minds. In a world clamoring for our attention with countless distractions, attending to God's wisdom requires intentionality and discipline. It means carving out time daily for the study of His Word, for prayer, and for quiet reflection, allowing His truth to speak into our circumstances. We cannot merely glance at Scripture; we must diligently apply ourselves to understanding it.

Finally, we are called to "bow thine ear to my understanding." This phrase suggests a posture of humility and submission. To "bow" is to yield, to incline oneself. It implies that we are not approaching God’s wisdom with our own preconceived notions or proud self-sufficiency, but with an open heart ready to receive and obey. It is an acknowledgment that God’s understanding is superior to our own, and that His ways are always perfect. When we humble ourselves before His truth, we are positioning ourselves to receive revelation and guidance that will truly transform our lives.

The chapters that follow this verse in Proverbs vividly illustrate the consequences of failing to attend to God's wisdom. They warn against immorality, deception, and the fleeting pleasures of sin, contrasting them with the lasting joy and security found in walking with the Lord. For the Southern Baptist and Independent Baptist believer, this verse is a foundational call to embrace the inerrant Word of God as our ultimate guide. It reminds us that our spiritual health and our ability to navigate a complex world depend entirely on our willingness to listen intently and obey humbly the wisdom that comes from above. Let us daily resolve to attend to His wisdom and bow our ears to His understanding.

Heavenly Father, help us to always attend to Your wisdom and humbly bow our ears to Your understanding, so that we may walk in Your perfect will all the days of our lives.
