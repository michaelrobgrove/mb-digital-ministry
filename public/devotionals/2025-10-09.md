# The Wisdom of Love and Discretion

Proverbs 17:9 (KJV) presents us with a profound insight into the very heart of human relationships and the character of Godly love: "He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends." This verse lays before us two distinct paths, each with vastly different outcomes, especially within the precious bonds of friendship and fellowship.

Consider first the wisdom of "he that covereth a transgression." To "cover" here does not mean to condone or ignore sin in a way that enables unrighteousness. Rather, it speaks to the grace-filled act of discretion, forgiveness, and choosing not to expose or dwell upon a brother's or sister's misstep, particularly when genuine repentance has occurred or when it's a private matter among friends. This action is rooted in "love." It's the kind of selfless, agape love that seeks to restore, to heal, and to preserve the relationship, rather than to shame or to gain personal advantage. Just as Christ's boundless love covers our multitude of sins when we come to Him in faith, so are we called to extend a measure of that covering love to those around us. It fosters an environment of trust, safety, and genuine Christian fellowship, allowing for growth and restoration.

In stark contrast stands the one "that repeateth a matter." This individual is characterized by a propensity to gossip, to rehash old offenses, or to needlessly broadcast the faults of others. Whether driven by a desire for attention, a critical spirit, or simply a lack of self-control, the consequence is clear and devastating: he "separateth very friends." Words possess immense power, either to build up or to tear down. When we repeatedly bring up past mistakes, spread rumors, or delight in recounting another's failings, we sow seeds of distrust, resentment, and division. Such actions erode the very foundation of friendship, creating chasms where once there was unity. True friendship, grounded in Christ, thrives on loyalty, grace, and a willingness to overlook a fault for the sake of love, not on the eager exposure of every flaw.

As believers, we are called to be ministers of reconciliation, not separation. Our words and attitudes should reflect the love of Christ, seeking to build bridges, not burn them. Let us pray for discernment to know when to speak and when to remain silent, when to forgive and when to confront in love, and always to prioritize the preservation of godly relationships over the fleeting satisfaction of gossip or judgment. May our lives be marked by the covering love that binds hearts together, rather than the repeating tongue that tears them apart.

Heavenly Father, help us to be swift to cover transgressions in love and slow to repeat matters that separate friends, for Your glory and the unity of Your people. Amen.
