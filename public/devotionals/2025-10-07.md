# The Golden Words We Speak

"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver." (Proverbs 25:11, KJV)

What a beautiful and profound image King Solomon presents to us in this verse! Our God, who created all things by His Word, deeply cares about the words that come from our mouths. He desires that our speech would not only be true but also timely, appropriate, and impactful—like "apples of gold in pictures of silver."

Consider first "a word fitly spoken." This is not just any word, nor is it merely a true word. It is a word delivered with wisdom, discernment, and graciousness, perfectly suited to the moment and the person receiving it. It requires an understanding heart, often guided by the Holy Spirit, to know *when* to speak, *what* to say, and *how* to say it. An unreserved or ill-timed word, even if true, can cause damage, but a word "fitly spoken" builds up and blesses. It is a word seasoned with grace, offered with love, and intended for edification.

When such a word is spoken, it is "like apples of gold." Imagine the rarity and beauty of golden apples! They are precious, valuable, and radiant. A fitly spoken word carries immense spiritual value. It can bring comfort to the grieving, conviction to the wayward, encouragement to the faint-hearted, and clarity to the confused. It has the power to heal relationships, diffuse tension, share the Gospel effectively, and bring glory to God. Unlike idle chatter or careless gossip, these words are treasures, reflecting the wisdom and purity of God Himself.

And these golden apples are presented "in pictures of silver." The silver setting enhances the beauty and value of the gold. This speaks to the *manner* in which our words are delivered. Our tone, our attitude, our compassion, our humility—these are the "pictures of silver" that frame our message. Truth spoken harshly, without love or respect, can lose its luster. But when truth is spoken with a Christ-like spirit, with genuine care and gentleness, it becomes irresistibly appealing and truly effective. Our character and our witness serve as that silver frame, making the "golden apple" of our words all the more precious and impactful.

As believers, let us prayerfully consider our words. May we ask the Lord to grant us the wisdom to speak fitly, allowing the Holy Spirit to guide our tongues. Let our speech be a testament to His grace, bringing forth golden apples that bless others and honor our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

Heavenly Father, help us to speak words that are fitly chosen, bringing You glory and building up those around us. Amen.
