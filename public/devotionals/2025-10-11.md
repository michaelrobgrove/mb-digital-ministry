# The Peril of Unheeded Instruction

Proverbs, a book brimming with divine wisdom, often presents stark contrasts between the path of the righteous and the way of the wicked. Today’s verse, Proverbs 5:23, delivers a solemn warning that cuts to the very heart of spiritual existence: "He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray." This isn't merely a comment on worldly success; it's a profound statement about eternal destiny.

The "instruction" spoken of here is not simply academic knowledge, but the life-giving wisdom and guidance that come from God Himself. It is the truth revealed in His Holy Word, the counsel of godly mentors, and the conviction of the Holy Spirit. To be "without instruction" is to willingly close one's ears and heart to the voice of the Almighty, choosing instead to navigate life's treacherous waters by one's own limited understanding. It is a refusal to embrace the lamp unto our feet and light unto our path that God so graciously provides.

When instruction is spurned, "the greatness of his folly" takes over. Folly, in biblical terms, is not mere ignorance but an active rejection of God's wisdom. It is a stubborn clinging to self-will, a preference for sin's fleeting pleasures over righteousness's enduring peace. This "greatness" implies a deep-seated, persistent foolishness that actively leads one away from the path of life. The individual, steeped in their own misguided ways, inevitably "shall go astray"—wandering off the narrow road that leads to salvation and onto the broad path that leads to destruction.

The ultimate consequence of this rejection is devastating: "He shall die without instruction." This speaks not only of physical death but, more critically, of spiritual death—eternal separation from the holy presence of God. To face eternity having rejected the very instruction that offered salvation through Jesus Christ is the greatest tragedy imaginable. It means standing before a just God, utterly unprepared, without the covering of Christ's righteousness, because the instruction for life was despised.

Brothers and sisters in Christ, let this verse be a powerful reminder for us. Let us cherish God's Word as our supreme instruction. Let us eagerly seek wisdom, walk in obedience, and never allow the "greatness of folly" to lure us astray. For those who have not yet embraced the saving instruction found in the Gospel, the warning is clear: do not face eternity without the one true Teacher, Jesus Christ, who alone offers the instruction for eternal life.

Heavenly Father, grant us humble hearts to receive Your divine instruction daily, that we may walk in wisdom and never stray from Your righteous path. Amen.
