# A Heart Responsive to God's Word

Proverbs 29:19 presents a sobering truth about human nature, stating, "A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer." At first glance, this verse might seem to describe a literal household servant, but its profound wisdom extends far beyond that historical context. It speaks to a spiritual condition that can afflict any one of us, even those who claim to be devoted servants of the Most High God. This proverb emphasizes the critical importance of a receptive heart to divine instruction, a cornerstone of biblical faith.

Consider the two key parts of this proverb. First, "A servant will not be corrected by words." This isn't about a lack of clear instruction or the absence of God's truth; it's about a profound resistance to it. The words are spoken, the truth from God's Word is presented, but there's an internal refusal to accept or act upon the correction. It suggests a stubbornness of spirit, a will set against divine change. This person, for whatever reason – be it pride, fear, resentment, or a hardened heart – has chosen not to yield to what is clearly understood.

Second, "for though he understand he will not answer." This is perhaps the most convicting part for believers. The issue is not ignorance. The servant *understands* what is being said. He comprehends the instruction, the rebuke, or the call to change from God's Holy Word. Yet, despite this understanding, he offers no response, no agreement, no promise of obedience, and no explanation. His silence is not born of confusion but often of defiance or an unwillingness to fully engage with the truth. It's a deliberate refusal to let the words penetrate and transform his life.

As followers of Christ, we are called to be willing servants of God (Romans 6:22). How often do we find ourselves in a similar spiritual state? God, through His Holy Word, through the faithful preaching of His truth, and through the wise counsel of spiritual leaders and fellow believers, constantly speaks to us. He corrects, guides, and admonishes. Do we listen with open, humble hearts, ready to respond in immediate obedience? Or do we, like the servant in Proverbs, hear the words, understand their meaning and biblical basis, yet remain silent and unmoving in our actions?

To understand God's correction and yet refuse to answer with obedience is a spiritually dangerous place to be. It demonstrates a heart not fully surrendered to the Lordship of Christ and the authority of Scripture. When we stiffen our necks against God's loving discipline, we invite stagnation in our spiritual walk and miss out on the abundant blessings that come from walking in His perfect ways. Let us earnestly pray for hearts that are soft and pliable, quick to hear, and even quicker to respond to the gentle (or sometimes firm) correction of our Heavenly Master. Let us not be servants who merely understand, but servants who answer with repentant hearts and obedient lives, honoring God with our active submission to His Word.

Heavenly Father, grant us humble and responsive hearts, always ready to hear and obey Your correcting Word.
