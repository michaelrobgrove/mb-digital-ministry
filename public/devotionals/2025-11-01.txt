# The All-Seeing Heart of God

Proverbs 15:11 (KJV) presents a profound truth about the Almighty God: "Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?" This verse unveils the incredible depth of God's knowledge, reminding us that nothing is hidden from His all-penetrating gaze.

Consider the first part: "Hell and destruction are before the LORD." These are not mere concepts or distant realities to our God; they are "before" Him. This means He knows them intimately, comprehensively. He understands the profound spiritual truth of Hell – a literal, eternal place of conscious torment, ordained for those who reject Him – and the destructive path of sin that leads there. His knowledge of such ultimate spiritual realities is perfect and complete. He sees every soul spiraling toward destruction, and every soul secured in His salvation.

Now, contemplate the powerful "how much more then the hearts of the children of men?" If God so perfectly understands the mysteries of Hell and the full scope of destruction, how infinitely more does He scrutinize and comprehend the inner workings of our human hearts? We may successfully hide our true motives, our secret sins, our unconfessed desires, and our selfish ambitions from our closest friends, our family, and even ourselves. We can put on a good front, project an image of piety, and perform outward acts of righteousness. But the Lord sees past every facade.

He knows our every thought before we think it, our every intention before we act on it, our every lust, envy, pride, and bitterness. He discerns the genuine from the counterfeit, the true devotion from the mere performance. This truth should humble us, convict us, and stir us to genuine repentance.

For the unsaved, this is a sober warning: God knows your lost condition, your rebellion, and the true state of your soul. There is no escaping His knowledge or His ultimate judgment apart from Christ. For the believer, it is a call to radical integrity. We are called not just to outward obedience, but to inward purity. Let us examine our hearts in light of this truth. Are we harboring sin? Are our motives pure? Are we truly walking with Him, or merely going through the motions? This verse compels us to confess our secret sins, to surrender our hidden strongholds, and to seek a heart that is truly pleasing to Him. For God, who sees the depths of Hell, surely sees the deepest chambers of our hearts. Let us strive to live authentically before Him, allowing His Word and Spirit to continually cleanse and sanctify our inner being.

Heavenly Father, we acknowledge Your perfect knowledge of all things, especially the innermost parts of our hearts; help us to live in truth and purity before You always, in Jesus' Name. Amen.
