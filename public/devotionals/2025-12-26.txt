# Let Not Thine Heart Envy Sinners

In a world often enamored with fleeting success and immediate gratification, the words of Proverbs 23:17 offer a timeless and vital warning: "Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long." This powerful verse calls us to a radical reorientation of our hearts, away from the deceptive allure of the world and toward the steadfast truth of God.

It’s a common human struggle to look at those who seemingly reject God’s ways, yet appear to prosper. They might accumulate wealth, enjoy worldly pleasures, or live without immediate consequences for their ungodly choices. Our fleshly hearts, prone to covetousness and short-sightedness, can easily fall into the trap of envy. We might think, "Why should I strive to live righteously when others seem to get ahead by cutting corners or living selfishly?" Such thoughts are spiritual poison, slowly eroding our faith and breeding discontentment with the path God has set for us. To envy sinners is to value their temporary triumphs over God's eternal promises and unfailing justice. It's to question God's wisdom and goodness, and to betray our calling as His children. The world's pleasures are fleeting, and its prosperity is a mirage that ultimately leads to destruction.

But the proverb doesn't leave us in this state of spiritual peril. It immediately offers the divine antidote: "but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long." This "fear of the LORD" is not a cowering dread, but a profound, reverent awe—a deep respect for His holy character, His sovereign power, and His unwavering justice. It’s an acknowledgement that He is God, and we are His creation. This holy fear compels us to obey His commands, to trust His perfect plan, and to seek His glory above all else. When our hearts are filled with the fear of the Lord, the temporary glitter of the world fades into insignificance. We understand that true prosperity is not found in earthly gains but in a right relationship with our Creator and obedience to His Word.

Notice the emphasis: "all the day long." This isn’t a fleeting emotion or a Sunday-only devotion. It’s a continuous posture of the heart, a constant awareness of God’s presence and His righteous standards. It means making daily choices that honor Him, speaking words that glorify Him, and pursuing thoughts that align with His truth. When we live in this constant state of reverent submission, the temptation to envy the temporary fortunes of sinners loses its grip. Our hope is anchored not in this fallen world, but in the eternal King of Kings, whose righteousness endures forever.

May we diligently guard our hearts from the snare of envy, and instead, cultivate a deep and abiding fear of the Lord, making it the guiding principle of our lives, all the day long.

*Heavenly Father, help us to fix our eyes upon You, to fear Your holy name above all else, and to find our true contentment in Your unfailing love and eternal promises.*
