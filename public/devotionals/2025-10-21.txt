# The Intentions of the Heart

Proverbs 14:22 presents a profound truth, challenging us to examine the very wellspring of our actions: our intentions. The King James Version reads, "Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good." This verse starkly contrasts two paths, revealing God’s perspective on the thoughts and purposes of the human heart.

The opening question, "Do they not err that devise evil?" is a rhetorical one, demanding an emphatic "yes!" To "devise evil" means to plot, scheme, or purpose wickedness in one's heart. Before a sinful act is committed, it is first conceived in the mind. The Bible teaches us that the natural human heart, apart from Christ, is deceitful and desperately wicked (Jeremiah 17:9). Those who willingly and actively plan malice, deceit, or harm are not merely mistaken; they "err" in a spiritual sense, straying far from God's righteous path. Their thoughts and intentions are an offense to a holy God, separating them from His divine favor and blessings. This inward sin is just as grievous as outward transgression, for God looks upon the heart.

In glorious contrast, the verse offers a wonderful promise: "but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good." To "devise good" means to purpose righteousness, kindness, purity, and actions that honor God and bless others. This is not a suggestion that good works earn salvation, for we are saved by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). Rather, it speaks of the fruit of a regenerated heart—a heart transformed by the Spirit of God that genuinely desires to please Him. When a believer’s heart is set on pursuing good, God responds with His boundless "mercy" and steadfast "truth."

"Mercy" signifies God’s compassion and undeserved kindness, extended to us despite our imperfections. It covers our shortcomings and grants us peace. "Truth" represents God’s faithfulness, His unwavering character, and the certainty of His promises. For those whose intentions are aligned with His will, God assures His constant presence, His guiding hand, and His unfailing blessings. Their lives will be marked by His divine favor.

Let us, therefore, prayerfully examine our own hearts today. What are we devising? Are our thoughts filled with Christ-like love and a desire for righteousness, or do we harbor resentment, envy, or selfish ambitions? May we strive daily to surrender our intentions to the Lord, trusting that He will cultivate within us a heart that devises good, bringing forth His mercy and truth into our lives.

Heavenly Father, cleanse our hearts and minds that we may always devise that which is good and pleasing in Thy sight, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
