# The Enduring Power of Tender Nurturing

Proverbs 29:21 offers a profound insight into the power of consistent, tender nurturing: "He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length." At first glance, this might seem like an unusual proposition in a culture where status was often rigidly defined. Yet, the wisdom here transcends social structures, speaking to a deep spiritual truth about the impact of dedicated care.

The key lies in the phrase "delicately bringeth up." This isn't just about providing food and shelter, or even merely imparting knowledge or harsh discipline. It speaks of a careful, tender, and patient investment from a young age. It implies a nurturing hand that seeks to understand, guide, and develop the whole person, not just to enforce obedience. This 'delicate' upbringing is consistent, loving, and focused on the long-term well-being and character of the individual.

When we apply this principle, we see its relevance in many areas of life, especially within the Christian home and church. Parents are called to "bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4). This isn't merely issuing commands, but diligently discipling, teaching God's Word, and demonstrating Christ-like love. When we 'delicately bring up' our children in the ways of the Lord from a young age, we are not just raising dutiful followers, but cultivating hearts that grow in loyalty and love for God and family, ultimately desiring to serve Him with devotion akin to a son's devotion to a father.

The promised outcome, "shall have him become his son at the length," highlights a remarkable transformation. The original relationship, that of master and servant, evolves into something far deeperâ€”a bond of mutual respect, trust, and even affection. This 'son-like' devotion goes beyond mere duty; it reflects a shared purpose, a loyalty born of love, and a desire to honor the one who invested so much. In our churches, this principle guides our approach to discipleship. When seasoned believers lovingly mentor new converts or younger members, patiently teaching and demonstrating the faith, they are 'delicately bringing up' spiritual children. The aim is not merely to create church attenders, but to cultivate faithful, devoted followers of Christ who feel a deep, familial connection to the body of Christ and to the God they serve.

This proverb reminds us of the profound impact of intentional, loving investment in the lives of others. Whether we are parents, Sunday school teachers, deacons, or simply older believers, we have an opportunity to 'delicately bring up' those God has placed in our sphere of influence. Let us not shy away from the patient, consistent work of nurturing hearts and minds in the truth of God's Word, knowing that such dedicated effort can foster loyalty, devotion, and a deep, lasting connection that honors the Lord.

Lord, help us to be diligent and tender in nurturing those You have entrusted to our care, for Your glory.
