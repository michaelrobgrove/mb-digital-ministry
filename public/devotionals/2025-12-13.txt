# A Reflection on Proverbs 30:29

Agur, the author of this portion of Proverbs, possessed a discerning eye for the created world and its spiritual parallels. In today's verse, he introduces a fascinating observation: "There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:" (Proverbs 30:29). He’s speaking of admirable qualities, actions, or characteristics that are strong, purposeful, and honorable in their very movement or existence. The King James Version's choice of "go well" and "comely in going" evokes images of grace, power, and effectiveness.

As believers, this verse calls us to reflect on our own "going." How do we, as followers of Christ, conduct ourselves in the world? Is our walk, our daily life, characterized by qualities that are "comely" – beautiful, fitting, and honorable – in the sight of God and man?

Firstly, to "go well" implies a sense of purpose and direction. The Christian life is not an aimless wandering but a purposeful journey, guided by the infallible Word of God and the indwelling Holy Spirit. We are called to live intentionally, seeking first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (Matthew 6:33). Our decisions, our words, and our actions should align with God's will, demonstrating a steadfast commitment to His truth.

Secondly, "comely in going" suggests an attractiveness, not of worldly vanity, but of spiritual grace. A life lived in obedience to Christ, marked by love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance (Galatians 5:22-23), naturally possesses a beauty that draws others. This comeliness reflects the character of our Savior, testifying to His transforming power. When we walk according to God's principles, even amidst a crooked and perverse generation, our lives shine as lights, glorifying our Father in Heaven.

Finally, the spirit of this verse reminds us of strength and conviction. The things Agur describes in the subsequent verses are not easily deterred or turned aside. Likewise, our faith should be unwavering, our stand for truth firm. In a world constantly shifting its values, we are to be unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord (1 Corinthians 15:58). This steadfastness in doctrine and devotion ensures that our "going" is not only comely but also impactful for the Kingdom.

Let us prayerfully consider our own paths. Are we "going well"? Is our life "comely in going"? May we strive, by God's grace, to live in a manner that brings glory to Him, faithfully reflecting His wisdom and beauty in every step we take.

Heavenly Father, help us to walk purposefully and live comely lives that honor Your Name and bear witness to Your saving grace. Amen.
