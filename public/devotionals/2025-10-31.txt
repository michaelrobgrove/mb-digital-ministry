# The Enduring Call of Wisdom

"Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man." (Proverbs 8:4, KJV)

In this profound verse from the book of Proverbs, we hear a clear, unmistakable declaration. It is a direct address, a divine summons resounding across the ages, not to a select few, but "Unto you, O men," and "to the sons of man"â€”a call to all humanity. The speaker here is Wisdom, personified, standing at the crossroads of life, extending an invitation that carries eternal weight.

For us, as believers, this personification of Wisdom points directly to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul teaches us in 1 Corinthians 1:24 that Christ is "the power of God, and the wisdom of God." He is the pre-existent *Logos*, the very Word of God made flesh, through whom all things were made. Therefore, when Wisdom calls in Proverbs 8, we hear the very voice of Christ, reaching out to a fallen world, offering truth, understanding, and eternal life.

This call is not a whisper to be easily missed; it is a clear, unwavering "voice." It's a testament to God's persistent love and His desire that none should perish, but that all should come to repentance and the knowledge of the truth (2 Peter 3:9). Despite our sin, our rebellion, and our natural inclination to stray, the voice of Wisdom continues to echo, offering a path to righteousness and peace.

What does this voice call us to? It calls us away from the folly and deception of the world. It calls us to lay aside our own limited understanding and embrace the eternal truths found in God's Word. It calls us to repentance for our sins and to faith in Jesus Christ as our only hope for salvation. It calls us to live lives that honor God, marked by integrity, humility, and obedience.

Today, how do we hear this voice? We hear it primarily through the Holy Scriptures, the inspired and infallible Word of God, which testifies of Christ. We hear it as the Holy Spirit convicts our hearts, revealing our need for a Savior and guiding us into all truth. And we hear it as we gather with fellow believers, as the Word is preached and fellowship is shared.

The greatest tragedy is to hear the call of Wisdom and choose to ignore it. The world offers countless distractions and false promises, attempting to drown out the divine voice. But to heed Christ's call is to choose life over death, light over darkness, and eternal joy over temporary pleasures. Let us, therefore, open our hearts and ears, ready to respond to the enduring call of our Savior.

Heavenly Father, help us to always hear and obey the voice of Your Son, Jesus Christ, our eternal Wisdom and Lord.
