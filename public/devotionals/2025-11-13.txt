# The Mirror of the Heart

Our verse for today, Proverbs 27:19, paints a vivid picture for us: "As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man." Consider the simple act of looking into a clear pool of water or a mirror. What do you see? You see your own reflection, your true outward appearance. Every feature, every wrinkle, every expression is revealed plainly back to you. The water holds no judgment, no pretense; it simply shows what is.

This physical reflection serves as a profound metaphor for the spiritual reality of our hearts. Just as water reflects our physical face, our interactions with other people often reflect the true condition of our own hearts. When we engage with "man to man," our deepest attitudes, motivations, and character are brought to the surface and revealed. How do you react when you are wronged? What are your thoughts when you see another blessed? Do you find yourself quick to judge, or quick to offer grace? These responses are not just about the other person; they are a mirror showing you what truly resides within your own heart.

The Bible teaches us that "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?" (Jeremiah 17:9). Left to ourselves, our natural inclination is towards sin, selfishness, and pride. Therefore, when we see aspects of impatience, envy, anger, or unforgiveness revealed in our interactions, it is not cause for despair, but for honest self-examination and repentance. These reflections serve as a vital call to look inward, not just outward. They prompt us to ask, "Is my heart truly aligned with Christ?"

Praise God that He does not leave us in the state of a wicked heart! Through the saving grace of Jesus Christ, our hearts can be cleansed, forgiven, and transformed. When we place our faith in Him, He gives us a new heart, a Spirit-filled heart that desires to honor Him. And as our hearts are transformed by His Holy Spirit, our "face" – that is, our character and our interactions – begins to answer differently to "man to man." We begin to reflect His love, His patience, His forgiveness, and His grace.

Let us, therefore, approach our relationships not just as opportunities to engage with others, but as sacred mirrors that show us what God is doing, or still needs to do, within us. May our hearts, renewed by Christ, truly answer to man with the very character of God, shining His light in a broken world.

Heavenly Father, we pray You would search our hearts today, reveal anything not pleasing to You, and continually transform us by Your grace through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
