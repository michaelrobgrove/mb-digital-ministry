# Standing Firm on God's Landmarks

Today's wisdom from Proverbs 23:10 in the King James Version offers a profound double admonition: "Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless." While these words had a literal meaning for ancient Israel, warning against the illegal and immoral practice of moving boundary stones to defraud the vulnerable, they carry timeless spiritual and ethical weight for us as believers today.

First, "Remove not the old landmark." In ancient times, landmarks were vital for establishing property boundaries, often passed down through generations. To move one was to commit fraud, stealing from a neighbor. Spiritually, these "old landmarks" represent the foundational, unchanging truths of our Christian faith – the doctrines and principles established by God Himself and revealed in His inerrant Word. These are not man-made traditions, but divine truths: the verbal plenary inspiration and authority of the Bible, the virgin birth and deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His substitutionary atonement on the cross, His bodily resurrection, and salvation by grace through faith alone. These are the immovable truths upon which our salvation and our hope are built.

In an age of shifting cultural tides and theological compromise, there is a constant temptation to "remove" these landmarks – to reinterpret, dilute, or even deny core biblical doctrines to fit worldly philosophies. But we are called to stand firm on "the old paths, where is the good way" (Jeremiah 6:16). To remove these spiritual landmarks is to lose our bearings, to drift from the anchor of truth, and ultimately, to jeopardize the eternal souls of men. We must guard these truths diligently, teach them faithfully, and defend them courageously.

Second, "and enter not into the fields of the fatherless." This speaks to the ethical implications of our faith. The fatherless, along with widows and sojourners, were among the most vulnerable in society. To exploit them was a heinous crime in God's eyes. This command calls us to live lives of integrity, compassion, and justice. It reminds us that our faith is not merely intellectual assent to doctrine, but a practical outflow of love and righteousness in our daily interactions. We are to treat others, especially the weak, the poor, and the marginalized, with fairness and grace, never seeking to exploit their disadvantage for our own gain. God is a defender of the helpless, and He will hold us accountable for how we treat our neighbor.

These two commands are intrinsically linked. When we begin to remove the doctrinal landmarks – compromising on the truth of God's Word – it often leads to a weakening of our moral compass and a greater susceptibility to selfish and ungodly behavior, including the exploitation of others. A firm foundation in biblical truth enables and encourages righteous living.

Let us, therefore, remain steadfast in upholding the unchangeable landmarks of our faith and committed to living out that faith with unwavering integrity and compassion.

Heavenly Father, help us to stand firm on Your unchanging Word, never compromising Your truth, and to live lives marked by integrity and love towards all, especially the vulnerable. Amen.
