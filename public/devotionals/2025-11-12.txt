# A Precious Stewardship: Reflecting on Proverbs 17:8

The King James Version of Holy Scripture presents timeless truths for our walk with God. Today, our focus rests on a powerful declaration from the book of Proverbs: "A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth." (Proverbs 17:8). This verse invites us to consider the profound value and enduring impact of a truly cherished gift.

Think of a precious stone – a diamond, a ruby, a sapphire. Its value isn't just in its rarity, but in its inherent beauty, its enduring nature, and the joy it brings to its possessor. In the same way, the gifts God bestows upon us are infinitely more precious. Our salvation, bought by the blood of Jesus Christ, is the ultimate gift, a treasure beyond earthly compare. But God also grants us spiritual gifts, unique talents, abilities, and opportunities – all "precious stones" in the eyes of those who truly understand their divine origin and purpose. When we "have" these gifts, not just intellectually but spiritually possessing them through faith and gratitude, their worth becomes immeasurable.

The latter part of the verse, "whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth," holds a glorious promise for the believer. This is not a guarantee of worldly riches, but a spiritual assurance of fruitfulness and divine blessing when God's gifts are rightly applied. When the gift of salvation is genuinely received and lived out, it doesn't just benefit the individual; it influences families, communities, and indeed, the world through evangelism and discipleship. When a spiritual gift – be it teaching, service, evangelism, or mercy – is exercised for the glory of God within the local church, it "turns" toward its intended purpose and "prospereth," building up the body of Christ and extending His Kingdom.

Every talent, every skill, every resource we possess can be seen as a gift from the Lord. When we consecrate these "precious stones" to Him, allowing them to "turn" in service to His will, they invariably prosper. They bear fruit that glorifies God, blesses others, and contributes to eternal purposes. Let us therefore value these divine endowments and be faithful stewards, ensuring that every gift God has placed in our hands is put to work for His honor.

May we diligently use the precious gifts You have given us, Lord, to further Your Kingdom and bring You glory in all that we do.
