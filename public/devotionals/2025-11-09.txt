# Keep Your Eyes on God's Wisdom

"My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:" (Proverbs 3:21, KJV)

In these precious verses from Proverbs, our Heavenly Father, through the wise Solomon, extends a tender yet firm command to us, His children. The opening phrase, "My son," establishes a loving, paternal tone, reminding us that these are not mere suggestions, but vital instructions for a life blessed by God.

The "them" that should not depart from our eyes refers to the wisdom, understanding, and instruction spoken of throughout the earlier part of Proverbs chapter three. This means we are to constantly keep God's truth, His divine insight, and His holy principles ever before us. It's a call to spiritual vigilance. In a world clamoring for our attention, filled with distractions and deceits, it is easy for our gaze to wander. We are bombarded with worldly philosophies, temporary pleasures, and misleading ideologies that seek to pull our eyes away from eternal truths. But God admonishes us: do not let these precious gifts depart from your spiritual sight. Fix your eyes steadfastly upon His Word and His ways.

Furthermore, we are commanded to "keep sound wisdom and discretion." Sound wisdom is not merely intellectual knowledge or worldly cleverness; it is the practical, God-given insight that enables us to live righteously and make decisions that honor Him. It is wisdom that is solid, unshakeable, and effective in navigating the complexities of life. And discretion? This is the ability to make good judgments, to plan wisely, to discern between right and wrong, and to choose the path of righteousness. It is prudence in action, thinking carefully and prayerfully before we speak or act.

To keep sound wisdom and discretion means to actively pursue them, to guard them, and to apply them daily. How do we do this? Through diligent study of God's Word, fervent prayer for His guidance, and by meditating on His precepts day and night. It means seeking godly counsel and allowing the Holy Spirit to illuminate our understanding. When we keep our eyes fixed on God's wisdom and live with discretion, we walk in safety, honor His name, and experience the blessings of a life lived in obedience to Him. Let us constantly refresh our memory of His truth, ensuring His wisdom remains the guiding light for every step we take.

May we always keep sound wisdom and discretion before our eyes, by the grace of God.

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, help us to fix our eyes upon Your Word daily, that we may always keep sound wisdom and discretion in our hearts and minds. Amen.
