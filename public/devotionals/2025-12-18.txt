# The Peril of the Eye and the Tongue

Proverbs 10:10 (KJV) presents a stark and timeless warning about two distinct, yet equally destructive, forms of ungodliness: "He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall." This verse, in its directness, calls us to vigilant self-examination concerning our actions, even the most subtle, and our words, which often reveal the true condition of our hearts.

Consider first the man who "winketh with the eye." This is not an innocent blink, but a deliberate, often secretive, gesture of malice, mockery, or conspiracy. It is the knowing glance between those plotting mischief, the subtle nod of approval for unrighteousness, or the contemptuous look that dismisses another's pain. Such a silent act, though unspoken, often carries immense weight. It signifies a hidden heart of deceit, unkindness, or even treachery. The consequence is severe: it "causeth sorrow." This sorrow can be the pain of betrayal, the sting of being mocked, the burden of injustice, or the lasting hurt inflicted by secret malice. God sees these hidden acts and intentions, and His Word warns us that they invariably lead to suffering for others, and ultimately, for the one who initiates the sin. Our Lord Jesus taught that even a look can harbor sin, and we must therefore guard our eyes and the intentions behind them with all diligence.

Secondly, the verse turns its attention to "a prating fool." A "prating fool" is one who talks excessively, idly, boastfully, or without wisdom and restraint. Their speech is often characterized by gossip, slander, foolish jesting, or simply an inability to hold their tongue. While the winking eye may be subtle and hidden, the prating foolâ€™s sin is often quite public. The book of Proverbs frequently contrasts the wise man, who is careful with his words, with the fool, whose mouth is his ruin. The consequence for such unrestrained and ungodly speech is that he "shall fall." This fall can manifest as a loss of reputation, broken relationships, financial ruin, or spiritual downfall. James 3 reminds us of the immense power of the tongue, capable of both blessing and cursing. A heart not surrendered to Christ, and therefore uncontrolled in its speech, is destined for judgment and consequence.

In both instances, whether through a subtle glance or a torrent of foolish words, the message is clear: our conduct, both hidden and open, has profound effects. Let us pray for hearts renewed by the Holy Spirit, that our eyes may be pure and our tongues seasoned with grace and truth, bringing glory to God rather than sorrow or downfall.

Heavenly Father, grant us grace to guard our eyes from malice and our tongues from folly, that all our actions and words may bring You honor. Amen.
