# The Tender Heart and Treasured Instruction

Proverbs 4:3 gives us a tender glimpse into the early life of King Solomon, the author of much of this profound book of wisdom: "For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother." This verse speaks not just of a child's preciousness, but it powerfully sets the stage for the vital instruction that followed. It reminds us of a foundational truth: a heart prepared and softened by love is a heart ready to receive wisdom and guidance.

Solomon recalls himself as "tender," signifying his youth, vulnerability, and readiness to be molded. He was "only beloved" – uniquely cherished and deeply valued by his parents. This profound affection from David and Bathsheba, despite their complex history, created an environment where teaching could take deep root. Before wisdom could be imparted, a foundational relationship of trust and love had to be established. His parents, though imperfect, understood the divine mandate to train up a child, and they poured into him the truths they knew about God and His law.

This passage powerfully underscores the importance of parental influence and the sacred trust placed in Christian parents to disciple their children. Just as Solomon’s parents earnestly desired for him to walk in paths of righteousness, so too does God call believers to diligently teach their children His statutes and precepts (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). Our homes should be primary schools of faith, where children are not only loved but are also tenderly guided into an understanding of God’s Word and His will for their lives, laying a spiritual bedrock for their future.

Beyond the earthly family, this verse resonates deeply with our relationship to our Heavenly Father. We, too, are His "tender" and "beloved" children, redeemed and purchased by the precious blood of Jesus Christ. God's love for us is perfect, unwavering, and eternal, far exceeding any human affection. Because He loves us so dearly, He desires to instruct us in true wisdom, to lead us in paths of righteousness, and to protect us from the countless snares of this fallen world. He lovingly speaks to us through His inspired and infallible Word, the Bible, and through the gentle prompting of the Holy Spirit.

Are we, like young Solomon, truly receptive to this divine instruction? Do we approach God's Word with a tender heart, eager to learn, to grow, and to humbly obey its truths? May we never outgrow our need for spiritual nurture, always remaining teachable in the sight of our loving Heavenly Father. Let us cherish the wisdom He freely offers, allowing it to shape our character, inform our decisions, and faithfully guide our every step daily.

Heavenly Father, grant us tender hearts, ever open to Your beloved instruction and wisdom found in Your Holy Word. Amen.
