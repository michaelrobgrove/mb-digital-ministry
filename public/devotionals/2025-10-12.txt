# Go to the Ant, Thou Sluggard

The Bible, in its divine wisdom, does not shy away from addressing uncomfortable truths about human nature. In Proverbs 6:6, we encounter a direct and challenging call to self-reflection: "Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:" This verse, though brief, cuts to the heart of a common failing and offers a surprising, yet profound, source of wisdom.

The term "sluggard" immediately arrests our attention. It describes one who is lazy, indolent, or slow-moving, someone who avoids work or responsibility. Spiritually, a sluggard might be characterized by apathy towards God's Word, neglect of prayer, or an unwillingness to serve. Physically, it manifests as procrastination, lack of foresight, and an unwillingness to put forth effort. Such a lifestyle, the Bible consistently warns, leads to poverty, regret, and a wasted life.

But where does the Lord direct this "sluggard" for instruction? Not to a great king, nor a wise philosopher, but to the humble ant. This tiny creature, seemingly insignificant, becomes a powerful mentor. What can we learn from her "ways"?

First, the ant demonstrates **industry without a taskmaster**. She works diligently without anyone overseeing her or forcing her hand (Proverbs 6:7). Her labor is intrinsic, driven by an innate understanding of purpose. For the believer, this speaks to self-discipline and an internal motivation to do what is right, not just when observed, but always, as unto the Lord.

Second, the ant embodies **foresight and preparation**. "Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest" (Proverbs 6:7-8). She understands the seasons of life and prepares for the future. Are we, as Christians, preparing for the spiritual winter seasons of trial or temptation? Are we diligently storing up God's Word in our hearts, strengthening our faith, and serving Him faithfully today for the opportunities and challenges of tomorrow?

To "consider her ways" means to observe, reflect, and internalize these lessons. To "be wise" means to apply them. Wisdom is not merely knowledge; it is skill in living. The diligent life, marked by faithful effort and preparation, is a wise life, pleasing to God. Let us shed the cloak of spiritual or physical laziness and embrace the example of the ant, working heartily "as to the Lord, and not unto men" (Colossians 3:23).

Lord, grant us the diligence of the ant that we may labor faithfully in Your service and walk in wisdom all our days.
