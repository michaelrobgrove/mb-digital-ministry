# A Reflection on Proverbs 18:23

Our verse for today from the wisdom of Solomon presents a stark contrast in human interaction: "The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly." This proverb is not merely an observation of societal dynamics, but a profound insight into the fallen nature of man and a call for us, as believers, to reflect on our own hearts and conduct.

Consider first the posture of "the poor." To "use intreaties" means to plead, to make earnest requests, often from a position of need or humility. It speaks of a soul that recognizes its dependence, its lack, and must rely on the goodwill or mercy of another. In the spiritual realm, this is precisely our posture before a holy God. We are all spiritually poor, utterly bankrupt in righteousness, and must come to Him with "intreaties" for salvation, for forgiveness, and for daily sustenance. There is no room for pride when we approach the throne of grace; only humble supplication will suffice.

Now, turn to the unsettling truth about "the rich." The proverb states that they "answereth roughly." This is not an indictment of wealth itself, for God has blessed many with abundance, and some of the most faithful servants of God have been wealthy. Rather, it exposes a common pitfall of earthly prosperity: the dangerous tendency towards pride, arrogance, and a hardened heart. When one possesses much, there can be an inclination to forget dependence on God, to look down upon those less fortunate, and to respond to their pleas with indifference, dismissiveness, or even contempt. This "rough" answer reveals a lack of Christian love and compassion, which ought to characterize every follower of Christ, regardless of their station.

As Southern and Independent Baptists, we believe in the complete depravity of man and the transforming power of the Gospel. This verse reminds us that true riches are found not in material possessions, but in Christ Jesus, who "though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich" (2 Corinthians 8:9). His example calls us to humility, to compassion, and to treat others, especially the vulnerable, with grace and kindness, never with a rough or dismissive spirit.

Let us examine our own hearts today. Do we, in our interactions, reflect the humble spirit of Christ or the rough answer of worldly pride? Are we quick to extend mercy and help, or do we allow our own perceived status or self-sufficiency to harden us? May we ever remember our own spiritual poverty before God and extend the grace we have received to all those we encounter, regardless of their material state.

Lord, help us to always respond with the love and humility of Christ, remembering our own need for Your grace.
