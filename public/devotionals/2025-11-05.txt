# The Peril of the Tongue: Guarding Against Strife and Division

Today's timeless truth from Proverbs 16:28 shines a piercing light on the destructive power of our words and attitudes: "A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends." This verse is a solemn warning, calling us to examine our hearts and the impact we have on those around us.

First, consider the "froward man." The word "froward" describes someone perverse, stubborn, and inclined to oppose what is right. This individual does not seek harmony but actively "soweth strife." Like a farmer planting seeds, the froward person intentionally cultivates discord, arguments, and contention. They may delight in negativity, resist sound counsel, and find satisfaction in stirring up trouble. In a church, a family, or a community, such a spirit poisons the atmosphere, making genuine fellowship impossible and hindering the work of God. As believers, we are called to be peacemakers, not strife-makers, seeking to build up rather than tear down.

Then, the verse speaks of the "whisperer," a person who secretly spreads gossip, slander, or malicious rumors. This is not open disagreement, but an insidious, underhanded attack. Whispering operates in the shadows, planting seeds of doubt and suspicion in the minds of others. The devastating consequence of such backbiting is clearly stated: it "separateth chief friends." Even the strongest bonds of trust and affection can be shattered by the venom of a whispered word. Many a friendship, a family, and even a church has been irrevocably damaged by the subtle yet destructive nature of gossip.

As followers of Christ, we are exhorted to guard our tongues (James 3). Our words possess immense powerâ€”power to bless or to curse, to heal or to wound, to unite or to divide. Let us reflect today: Are our words a source of peace or discord? Do we build up our brethren, or do we, even subtly, engage in whispering that tears down? Let us strive to be known for words that are gracious, truthful, and edifying, reflecting the love of Christ. May we resist the temptation to be froward or to engage in whispering, remembering that the Lord hears every word and holds us accountable.

Lord, help us to guard our hearts and tongues, that our words may always bring glory to You and build up Your people in love and unity.
