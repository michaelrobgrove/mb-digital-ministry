# The Wisdom That Overcomes

Proverbs 21:22 (KJV) declares, "A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof." This powerful proverb paints a vivid picture of divine wisdom in action, demonstrating its capacity to overcome what appears to be unconquerable. It’s a profound truth that speaks to the believer’s journey in a world often dominated by seemingly impenetrable forces.

The "wise man" mentioned here is not merely one with worldly knowledge or intellectual prowess. In the biblical sense, true wisdom originates from God alone (James 1:5). It is a spiritual discernment, a Spirit-led understanding that enables us to see circumstances through God's eyes and act according to His will. This wisdom is forged in prayer, nourished by the Word of God, and applied through faith. It is this divine wisdom that empowers us, not our own strength or cleverness.

The "city of the mighty" symbolizes formidable obstacles, strongholds, and challenges that stand tall and appear unassailable in our lives or in the world around us. These could be deeply entrenched sinful habits, overwhelming financial burdens, spiritual attacks from the enemy, or pervasive worldly ideologies that contradict God's truth. Humanly speaking, such "cities" often seem too powerful to breach, their walls too high, their defenses too strong. We might feel intimidated, discouraged, or even defeated before we've truly begun.

However, the wise man "scaleth" this city. This implies not a frontal assault based on brute force, but a strategic, Spirit-led approach that finds a way over or through the seemingly impassable. And even more profoundly, he "casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof." This speaks to dismantling the very foundation of what gives the mighty city its perceived power. The "confidence" of the mighty is often rooted in their wealth, their military, their intellect, their self-sufficiency, or their perceived invincibility. But God-given wisdom reveals the emptiness and fragility of these worldly foundations. It exposes the lie that undergirds their strength, showing that true power rests only in the Almighty God.

For us today, this means that when we face personal struggles, cultural pressures, or spiritual battles that seem overwhelming, we are not to rely on our own might or understanding. Instead, we are to humbly seek God's wisdom. It is through His divine insight that we can identify the true nature of the obstacle, discern the enemy's tactics, and find the divinely appointed strategy to overcome. This wisdom enables us to expose the hollow confidence of the world's systems and to stand firm on the unshakable truth of God's Word, knowing that in Him, all things are possible.

Let us, therefore, earnestly pray for and pursue God's wisdom, trusting that through it, we can indeed scale the "cities of the mighty" and witness the triumph of His truth.

**Prayer:** Heavenly Father, grant us Your divine wisdom today, that we may discern Your path, overcome every obstacle by Your power, and bring glory to Your holy Name. Amen.
