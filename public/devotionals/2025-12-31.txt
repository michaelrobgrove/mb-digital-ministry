# The Desire and The Expectation

Proverbs 11:23 (KJV) presents us with a striking contrast, a divine mirror reflecting two fundamentally different hearts and their ultimate outcomes: "The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath." This single verse lays bare the profound truth about human nature and the just recompense of God.

Consider first the righteous. Who are they? Not those who perfectly adhere to every law in their own strength, but those who have been made righteous by faith in Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Through His shed blood and resurrection, we are declared holy in God’s sight, and His Spirit begins a transformative work within us. The King James Version states their "desire is only good." This isn't merely an occasional wish, but a deep, inward longing, a constant inclination of the heart. A truly regenerate believer, indwelled by the Holy Spirit, begins to desire what God desires. Their thoughts, ambitions, and plans, though imperfectly executed in this fallen world, are fundamentally aimed at glorifying God, serving others, and upholding biblical truth. They seek righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost (Romans 14:17). This desire for good manifests in humility, love, obedience to God's Word, and a longing to see His kingdom advance. It is a heart tuned to God’s will, striving to live a life pleasing to Him.

On the other hand, the verse starkly warns, "but the expectation of the wicked is wrath." The wicked are those who reject God's authority, live in rebellion against His commands, and refuse His offer of salvation. Their "expectation" is not a hope, but a sure and certain outcome, an anticipated destiny. For those who choose a path devoid of God, who cling to their sin and refuse repentance, the inevitable consequence is wrath. This is not arbitrary anger from a capricious deity, but the righteous, holy judgment of a just God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness (Romans 1:18). It is the culmination of a life lived apart from Christ, leading to eternal separation from His presence and enduring the just recompense for their sin. The wrath of God is a terrifying reality, a solemn reminder of His holiness and the seriousness of defying His perfect will.

This proverb calls each of us to examine our own hearts. What is our dominant desire? Is it for the good that aligns with God's perfect will, flowing from a heart made new in Christ? Or are our expectations rooted in selfish ambition, worldly pursuits, and a disregard for divine truth, leading us down a path toward eternal wrath? Let us pray for hearts that continually desire God's good, living in the glorious expectation of His eternal favor through Jesus Christ.

May our desires always align with Your holy will, O Lord, as we walk in the righteousness You have graciously provided through Your Son.
