# The Eternal Delight of God

Proverbs 8 presents us with a magnificent personification of Wisdom. For generations of devout believers, this Wisdom, especially in verses like Proverbs 8:22-31, points prophetically and profoundly to none other than our Lord Jesus Christ Himself. Before time began, before the mountains were shaped or the oceans measured, our verse for today reveals an eternal, intimate relationship within the Godhead: "Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;" (Proverbs 8:30).

Consider the profound truth embedded in "Then I was by him, as one brought up with him." This isn't a picture of creation, but of eternal co-existence. It speaks to the pre-existence and divine nature of Christ. He wasn't created; He was eternally present, intimately involved with the Father in the very councils of eternity. This echoes John 1:1, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Our Savior is not merely a prophet or a good man, but God incarnate, co-eternal with the Father.

The phrase, "and I was daily his delight," unveils the perfect, unbroken fellowship between the Father and the Son. There was no disharmony, no disappointment, no blemish in their relationship. The Son brought immense, unceasing joy to the Father. This pure, unadulterated love and affection is the very essence of the Godhead. It is out of this eternal, perfect love that the plan of redemption was conceived, a plan to extend this delight to fallen humanity.

Furthermore, "rejoicing always before him" shows us the Son's perfect joy in the Father. Their communion was one of mutual adoration and eternal satisfaction. Christ's joy was not contingent on anything external, but flowed from His perfect relationship with the Father.

What does this mean for us, dear believer? It means our salvation is rooted in an eternal, unshakeable love. The Christ who willingly stepped out of this eternal delight to suffer for our sins is the same Christ who desires to bring us into a relationship with God. When we accept Him as Lord and Savior, we are brought into fellowship with this very Godhead. We become His children, and through Christ, God takes delight in us, just as a loving Father delights in His redeemed children. We, too, are called to rejoice in Him always, finding our delight in His presence and His perfect will. Let us reflect on this profound truth today and live in the light of God's eternal delight in His Son, and by extension, in us through Him.

May we ever find our greatest joy and delight in our Lord Jesus Christ, mirroring the eternal delight of the Father in the Son.
