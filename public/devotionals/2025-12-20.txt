# Wisdom Cries in the Streets

The book of Proverbs begins with a stark, powerful image of wisdom. Our verse for today, Proverbs 1:20, declares, "Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:" (KJV). This isn't wisdom cloistered in a library or whispering in a secret society. No, this is wisdom personified, standing boldly in the public square, raising her voice for all to hear. She is not elusive; she is accessible, vibrant, and insistent.

Consider the setting: "in the streets." This is where life happens. It's the marketplace, the thoroughfare, the place of daily commerce, gossip, and interaction. It’s a place of noise, distraction, and often, foolishness. Yet, it is precisely here, in the midst of everyday life, that God's divine wisdom plants herself. She doesn't wait for us to seek her out in solitude; she comes to us, actively, publicly, making her truth known to every passerby. This emphasizes that God's wisdom is not reserved for the scholar or the saint locked away in prayer, but is freely offered to the common person navigating the challenges of life.

The words "crieth" and "uttereth her voice" suggest urgency and passion. Wisdom isn't merely mumbling; she is calling out, pleading, perhaps even warning. What is this wisdom calling for? She calls for discernment, for righteousness, for a turning away from the destructive paths of sin and folly. She invites us to embrace understanding, to choose life over death, and to walk in the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of all true wisdom. This call is a divine invitation to live a life that honors God and finds true flourishing.

For us as New Testament believers, this personified wisdom points ultimately to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He is "the wisdom of God" (1 Corinthians 1:24). His earthly ministry was an embodiment of wisdom crying in the streets – teaching in the synagogues, preaching on hillsides, healing in public places. His Gospel message is the ultimate call of divine wisdom, inviting all who hear to repent and believe, finding salvation and eternal life in Him. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and in Him "are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Colossians 2:3).

Today, are we listening to Wisdom's public cry amidst the clamor of our own "streets"? In a world filled with countless voices vying for our attention, let us tune our spiritual ears to the unwavering voice of God's truth, found in His Holy Word and illuminated by the Holy Spirit. Heed Wisdom's call, for in it lies true life.

Heavenly Father, help us to always hear and obey the clear voice of Your wisdom as it calls to us daily through Your Word and Your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.
