# Make Wisdom Your Sister

Proverbs 7:4 (KJV) tenderly instructs us, "Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:" This isn't merely a suggestion to acknowledge these virtues, but a powerful call to forge an intimate, familial bond with them. Imagine viewing wisdom not as a distant concept or an academic pursuit, but as a cherished sister, a trusted confidante who walks beside you through life's journey, offering counsel and protection.

In biblical times, a sister or kinswoman represented a close family tie, a bond of loyalty, protection, and shared life. To call wisdom your sister means to embrace her, to listen to her counsel, to seek her presence daily, and to allow her influence to shape your character and decisions. Likewise, understanding as a kinswoman implies a constant association, a willingness to be guided by her clarity in discerning truth from error. This intimate connection ensures that wisdom is not just observed but truly *internalized* and *lived out*.

But where does this profound wisdom originate? For the believing heart, true wisdom is not found in the fleeting philosophies of the world, but in the eternal counsel of Almighty God. It is revealed through His Holy Word, the Bible, and imparted by the Holy Spirit. Proverbs 9:10 reminds us, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding." To make wisdom our sister, we must first fear the Lord, diligently search His scriptures, and humbly pray for His discernment. This divine wisdom protects us from the snares of sin and guides us along the path of righteousness, just as a loving sister would warn of danger.

In a world saturated with confusing voices and deceptive paths, cultivating this intimate relationship with godly wisdom and understanding is more crucial than ever. Proverbs 7, in its broader context, warns against the seductive call of the adulteress; wisdom serves as our safeguard against such moral pitfalls and countless other temptations. It means prioritizing time in God's Word, meditating on its truths, and actively seeking God's will in every decision. When we treat wisdom as family, we consult her before acting, we seek her perspective in trials, and we allow her to steer our lives away from foolishness and towards God-honoring choices. This daily walk with wisdom brings peace, clarity, and a deeper walk with Christ, who Himself is "the wisdom of God" (1 Corinthians 1:24).

May we ever cultivate a deeper, more intimate relationship with Your divine wisdom, Father.
