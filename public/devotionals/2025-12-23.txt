# The Certainty of Judgment for the Deceitful

Our verse for today from Proverbs 19:5 delivers a stark and unwavering truth concerning the gravity of falsehood: "A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape." In a world where truth is often compromised, diluted, or even outright rejected, God’s Word stands firm as the ultimate standard of integrity and righteousness. This proverb is not merely a piece of ancient wisdom; it is a divine declaration of God's absolute justice and His unwavering commitment to truth.

Consider the weight of "a false witness" and "he that speaketh lies." This encompasses far more than just perjury in a courtroom. It extends to every whisper of gossip, every subtle misrepresentation, every exaggeration, and every deliberate deception uttered to gain an advantage or avoid discomfort. Whether in business, relationships, or even in our quiet thoughts, any departure from truth is a lie in God’s sight. The Lord, who is Himself the Way, the Truth, and the Life, cannot tolerate falsehood. His holy character demands absolute honesty from His creation.

The second part of the verse, "shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape," emphasizes the inevitability of divine accountability. There is no hiding place for deceit. Man may be fooled, but God is never mocked. Every secret word, every hidden motive, every uttered falsehood is laid bare before His omniscient gaze. We may escape the immediate consequences of human judgment, or even the pangs of our own conscience for a time, but we shall not escape God's ultimate justice. His righteous judgment is certain, and it will be meted out against all unrepentant liars.

For us as believers, this proverb serves as a powerful call to personal integrity and truthfulness. We are called to be imitators of Christ, who is the embodiment of truth. Our words, therefore, must reflect His character. How vital it is that our "yes" be yes, and our "no" be no (James 5:12). Let us examine our hearts, striving to speak only that which is true, pure, and honorable. Let us guard against the "little white lies" or convenient omissions that seem harmless but slowly erode our witness and dishonor our Lord. The consequences of a deceitful tongue extend beyond mere earthly reputation; they affect our standing before a holy God.

May we always walk in integrity, speaking truth in love, and honoring our Lord with every word.
