# The Lion in the Way

Proverbs, a book of divine wisdom, often lays bare the human heart with remarkable clarity. Today's verse, Proverbs 26:13, paints a vivid picture of a particular character: "The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets." This isn't just about physical laziness; it's a profound insight into the spiritual and mental state of one who avoids duty and responsibility.

The "slothful man" is defined by his inaction. He actively seeks to escape work, obligation, or any task requiring effort. To justify his idleness, he invents or exaggerates obstacles. He proclaims, "There is a lion in the way!" This "lion" serves as his convenient excuse – a formidable, terrifying danger that, in his mind, absolves him of any need to proceed. Whether the perceived threat is real or imagined is less important than its function: to provide a seemingly justifiable reason for doing nothing.

Consider the "lion in the way" not merely as a literal beast, but as any perceived difficulty, discomfort, or risk that deters us from our God-given responsibilities. It could be the fear of failure, the discomfort of an unfamiliar task, the perceived inadequacy for a ministry calling, or the challenge of sharing the Gospel with a skeptical world. For the slothful, these "lions" become insurmountable barriers, halting progress, stifling potential, and preventing the diligent stewardship of time and talent.

As believers, we are called to a life of diligence, not sloth. Paul admonishes us in Colossians 3:23 to work "heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men." Our Heavenly Father does not call us to tasks for which He will not equip us. While genuine obstacles exist, our faith teaches us to lean on God's strength, not to shrink back in fear. Is there a "lion" blocking your path today – perhaps a challenging witness opportunity, a difficult commitment in your church, or a personal area of spiritual growth you’ve been avoiding? We are reminded that "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (2 Timothy 1:7).

Let us examine our hearts. Are we prone to creating "lions" to excuse our spiritual or practical inaction? Are we allowing perceived difficulties to prevent us from obeying God’s call, serving others, or growing in our faith? May we cast off the spirit of slothfulness and, by God's grace, step forward in faith, trusting that He will either remove the lion or give us the strength and wisdom to overcome it. Our Lord deserves our diligent effort and courageous obedience, not our excuses.

Heavenly Father, help us to cast off slothfulness and, empowered by Your Spirit, to faithfully confront every "lion" in our path, for Your glory alone.
