# The Unstoppable March of Neglect

Proverbs 6:11 delivers a sobering warning that ought to pierce the heart of every believer: "So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man." This verse, situated within a broader admonition against the perils of idleness, paints a vivid picture of the inevitable and destructive consequences of neglecting our responsibilities. It is a powerful call to diligence, a foundational principle for a life honoring to God.

Consider first the phrase, "So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth." This speaks of a gradual, almost imperceptible approach. Poverty and want, whether material, spiritual, or moral, rarely arrive overnight as a sudden cataclysm. Instead, they often begin subtly, like a distant traveler on a long journey. It starts with "a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep" (Proverbs 6:10). It's the skipped quiet time, the unaddressed small sin, the procrastinated task, the neglected relationship. These minor concessions to laziness, seemingly insignificant in isolation, slowly but surely pave the way for a greater desolation. Like a traveler steadily drawing nearer, the consequences of our inaction are always advancing, even when we are oblivious to their approach.

But the warning intensifies: "and thy want as an armed man." Here, the imagery shifts dramatically. What began as a distant traveler eventually arrives with the force and inevitability of an armed assailant. Once neglect and idleness have had their way, the resulting "want" or destitution is not merely an inconvenience; it is a powerful, unyielding force that overtakes and overwhelms. An armed man takes what he desires without question, leaving ruin in his wake. Similarly, the consequences of habitual laziness – whether financial ruin, spiritual barrenness, or relational breakdown – will forcefully seize control, leaving us helpless and regretful. There is no negotiating with an armed man, and there is no escaping the harvest sown by persistent idleness.

This timeless wisdom of Proverbs compels us to look at the industrious ant (Proverbs 6:6-8) and learn. The ant, without external urging, diligently prepares for the future. As believers, we are called to be diligent stewards of all that God has entrusted to us: our time, our talents, our resources, our families, and especially our spiritual lives. Spiritual poverty, a barren heart, and a distant relationship with God can likewise creep in like a traveler, only to become an armed man, leaving us spiritually vulnerable and weak.

Let us heed this clear warning. Let us rise above the "little sleep" and "little slumber" that threaten to steal our productivity and spiritual vitality. May we cultivate a spirit of diligence, recognizing that our daily choices, however small, are either building up or tearing down. By God's grace, let us work with all our might, knowing that our labor in the Lord is never in vain.

Heavenly Father, grant us wisdom and diligence to live responsibly, avoiding the snares of idleness and faithfully stewarding Your gifts. Amen.
