# The Fleeting Wings of Riches

The inspired Word of God, through the pen of Solomon in Proverbs 23:5, presents a profound challenge to our priorities: "Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven." This verse serves as a sober warning to every believer against the deceptive allure of worldly wealth.

First, consider the piercing question: "Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?" This isn't merely a rhetorical inquiry; it’s an urgent call to examine the very object of our affections and ambitions. What does it mean for something to "be not"? It means it is insubstantial, ephemeral, lacking true and lasting reality. Riches, while appearing solid and desirable in this present world, are ultimately void of eternal substance. They cannot truly satisfy the soul, purchase salvation, or accompany us beyond the grave. To fix our gaze, our hope, and our energy upon such things is to pursue a phantom, a mirage that promises much but delivers only emptiness.

The latter part of the verse vividly illustrates this truth: "for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven." The imagery is striking. Wealth is not just temporary; it is actively, swiftly, and often unexpectedly transient. Like an eagle, known for its powerful flight and ability to soar high and out of sight, riches can depart with astounding speed. A sudden market crash, a devastating illness, an unforeseen loss, or even simply the passage of time can strip away what once seemed so secure. They do not merely fade; they take flight, leaving behind those who had anchored their hearts to them.

As Southern and Independent Baptists, we believe in the absolute authority of God's Word, and this passage calls us to a radical re-evaluation of our priorities. If earthly riches are so fleeting, if they are but "that which is not," then where should our true treasure lie? Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself taught us, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth... but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" (Matthew 6:19-20). Let us not fall prey to the world’s deceptive promises or allow covetousness to creep into our hearts. Instead, let us fix our eyes upon Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith, and pursue the eternal riches of His grace, His righteousness, and His kingdom, which can never take wings and fly away.

Heavenly Father, help us to set our eyes not on fleeting earthly riches, but on the eternal treasures found only in You and Your precious Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.
