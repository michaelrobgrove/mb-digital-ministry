# The Root and Fruit of a Rebellious Heart

Our verse today from Proverbs 6:14 presents a stark warning, unveiling the destructive progression of a heart estranged from God's wisdom: "Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord." This ancient wisdom speaks with timeless clarity to the perils of sin, beginning deep within the soul and manifesting in damaging ways.

First, consider "Frowardness is in his heart." The King James Version's "frowardness" describes a perverse, stubborn, and disobedient disposition. It is a spirit that resists divine truth and refuses to submit to righteousness. This isn't just an occasional lapse; it's a foundational issue, a deep-seated rebellion against God's holy standard. It reminds us of the fallen nature of mankind, where the heart, apart from Christ, is "deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked" (Jeremiah 17:9). A froward heart is set on its own way, rejecting the path of humility and obedience that God calls us to walk.

This internal rebellion inevitably spills outward. The verse continues, "he deviseth mischief continually." A heart bent on frowardness doesn't just stumble into sin; it actively plans and plots evil. "Deviseth mischief continually" implies premeditation, a persistent and deliberate intention to cause harm, trouble, or distress. It's a calculated effort to undermine, to hurt, to exploit. This stands in stark contrast to the believer's call to meditate on God's Word day and night, seeking His will and blessing others. Where God's Spirit leads to thoughts of love and good works, a froward heart hatches schemes of malice.

Finally, the devastating fruit of such a heart is revealed: "he soweth discord." Discord is strife, contention, and division. A person whose heart is perverse and continually plans mischief will inevitably become an agent of disunity. They introduce quarrels into families, stir up contention in churches, and break down harmony in communities. This is the very work of the adversary, who seeks to divide and conquer God's people. As believers, we are called to be peacemakers, to foster unity in the Spirit, and to build up the body of Christ in love. Sowing discord actively opposes these divine commands, tearing down what God seeks to build up.

Therefore, we must diligently guard our hearts, for "out of it are the issues of life" (Proverbs 4:23). Let us examine ourselves: Is there any frowardness lurking within? Are we prone to critical spirits, grumbling, or divisive talk? Instead of devising mischief, let us continually devise ways to bless, to encourage, and to share the Gospel. Instead of sowing discord, let us be diligent in sowing seeds of peace, love, and truth, cultivating an atmosphere where Christ's love can flourish. We must yield our hearts to the Holy Spirit, allowing Him to root out all rebellion and fill us with a desire for unity and righteousness.

Heavenly Father, cleanse our hearts of all frowardness, deliver us from mischievous thoughts, and empower us by Your Spirit to sow only peace and unity for Your glory. Amen.
