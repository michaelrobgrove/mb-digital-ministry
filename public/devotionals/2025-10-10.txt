# The Subtle Call of Folly

Proverbs chapter nine presents us with a powerful contrast, personifying two distinct paths: Lady Wisdom and Lady Folly. Lady Wisdom calls us to life, understanding, and fellowship with God. But it is Lady Folly's insidious invitation that we ponder today from verse 15 of the King James Version: "To call passengers who go right on their ways."

Consider for a moment the target of Lady Folly's seductive voice. She isn't just calling out to those already wandering in darkness, utterly lost and without direction. No, the scripture states she calls "passengers who go right on their ways." These are individuals who are seemingly on the straight and narrow path, endeavoring to live uprightly, seeking to honor God with their lives. Perhaps they are diligent churchgoers, faithful in their tithes, committed to studying their Bibles, and striving to raise their families in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. They are, by all outward appearances, going "right on their ways."

This verse serves as a sober warning to every believer. The enemy of our souls is not content merely with those who are obviously steeped in sin; he actively seeks to derail those who are earnestly pursuing righteousness. Lady Folly's strategy is subtle, her allure disguised. She whispers promises of pleasure, ease, or secret gratification, often cloaked in seemingly harmless diversions or minor compromises. Her invitation is to "stolen waters," which she deceptively claims are "sweet," and "bread eaten in secret," which she insists is "pleasant" (Proverbs 9:17). These are not overt acts of rebellion but often quiet deviations from God's perfect will, tempting us with what appears to be a shortcut or a momentary indulgence.

For Southern Baptists and Independent Baptists, who deeply value personal holiness and a walk of separation from the world, this is a critical reminder. Even when we believe we are firmly established on the path of righteousness, we must remain ever vigilant. Our flesh is weak, and the world is constantly clamoring for our attention, trying to lure us off course. Folly's call targets our moments of weakness, our pride, our desire for comfort, or our discontent.

How then do we resist this insidious call? We must continually turn to Lady Wisdom, who is Christ Jesus Himself, and His infallible Word. We must saturate our minds with scripture, commit ourselves to earnest prayer, seek fellowship with like-minded believers, and cultivate a discerning spirit. Let us not be complacent, thinking we are immune to Folly's charms because we are "going right on our ways." Instead, let us cling ever more tightly to the Lord, for only in Him do we find the strength to stand firm against every temptation and remain steadfast on the path that leads to eternal life.

Lord, strengthen us to discern Folly's deceptive calls and empower us to walk faithfully in Your righteous ways each day.
