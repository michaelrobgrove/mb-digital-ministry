# A Heart for Instruction

Our verse for today, Proverbs 13:18, presents us with a profound truth and a stark choice, echoing throughout the pages of God’s inspired Word: "Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured." This isn't merely human advice; it's divine wisdom, laying out two clear paths and their inevitable destinations.

Consider first the path of him "that refuseth instruction." The instruction spoken of here is not just casual advice, but fundamental teaching, particularly the instruction found in God's holy Word and delivered through faithful preaching and godly counsel. To refuse it is to turn away from wisdom itself, to stiffen one's neck against truth, often out of pride, stubbornness, or a love for sin. The consequence, the Scripture warns, is "poverty and shame." This poverty is not always financial, though foolish choices often lead there. More significantly, it is a spiritual poverty – a barren soul, devoid of true richness in character, wisdom, and peace. It is a life lacking the abundant blessings God desires for His children. And with this poverty comes "shame" – the disgrace, regret, and loss of testimony that inevitably follows a life lived contrary to God's righteous standards. How many lives have been marred, and how many testimonies tarnished, by a stubborn refusal to heed the clear warnings and loving guidance of the Lord?

But praise God, there is a second path, a path of blessing and honor! "But he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured." To "regard reproof" means to listen with humility, to take correction seriously, to ponder it in our hearts, and to be willing to change course when convicted. Reproof might come from a godly pastor's sermon, the gentle conviction of the Holy Spirit while reading the Scriptures, or the loving but firm words of a spiritual mentor. It requires a teachable spirit, one that values truth above self-will. The promise to such a heart is "honour." This honour is not primarily worldly acclaim, but rather the deep respect that comes from God and from fellow believers. It is the honour of walking in integrity, growing in wisdom, and being entrusted with greater responsibility in God's kingdom. It is the quiet dignity of a life aligned with divine principles, blessed by the Lord, and reflecting His character.

Brothers and sisters, let us examine our hearts today. Are we eagerly seeking instruction from God's Word? Are we truly open to reproof, even when it stings our pride? Let us cultivate a humble, teachable spirit, always ready to learn and to obey, that we might walk in the honour that comes from the Lord.

Lord, grant us humble hearts that eagerly embrace Your instruction and graciously receive Your reproof, that we may walk in Your honour all our days.
