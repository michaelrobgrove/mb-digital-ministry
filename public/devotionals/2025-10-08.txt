# Tending Our God-Given Responsibilities

Proverbs 27:23 gives us a clear, practical admonition: "Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds." On the surface, this verse speaks to the agrarian life of ancient Israel, emphasizing the careful stewardship required of a shepherd or farmer. It highlights the absolute necessity of diligence and watchful care for one's livelihood. But like all Scripture, this principle transcends its immediate context, offering profound wisdom for every believer in every age.

While most of us no longer tend literal flocks or herds, we are all entrusted with God-given responsibilities that require the same diligence. Our "flocks and herds" today might represent our families, our spiritual lives, our local church, our finances, our health, our vocations, or our witness for Christ. The command remains: "Be thou diligent to know the state" of these sacred trusts.

Diligence means more than just a passing glance; it implies intentional, consistent effort. It's not enough to merely possess these blessings; we must actively understand their condition. Do we know the spiritual state of our own hearts? Are we diligent in examining our walk with the Lord, ensuring we are rooted in His Word and growing in grace? Do we truly know the state of our families, understanding their needs, struggles, and joys, and providing spiritual guidance? Are we aware of the needs within our local church body, and are we actively participating in its health and ministry?

Furthermore, the verse commands us to "look well to thy herds." This is the active component of stewardship. Once we know the state, what are we doing about it? Are we neglecting the spiritual nourishment our souls require? Are we allowing the thorns of the world to choke out the spiritual fruit in our lives or the lives of our loved ones? Looking well means investing time, prayer, and effort. It means protecting what God has given us from the dangers and distractions of this world. It means faithful financial management, nurturing healthy relationships, and actively serving in the local assembly, ensuring its spiritual vitality.

A lazy or careless steward will soon find their "flocks" dwindling and their "herds" scattered. But the diligent believer, prayerfully tending to the responsibilities God has placed in their care, will experience His blessing and be a testament to His faithfulness. Let us therefore commit ourselves to being watchful, active, and prayerful stewards of all that the Lord has entrusted to us.

Heavenly Father, help us to be diligent and faithful stewards of all the spiritual and earthly blessings You have graciously placed in our care, for Your glory.
