# Stopping Strife Before the Flood

Proverbs 17:14 (KJV) offers a powerful warning and a clear command: "The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with." This verse paints a vivid picture, urging us to consider conflict's destructive nature and our call to be peacemakers.

Imagine a small crack in a dam. At first, it's just a trickle, easily ignored. But given time, that trickle can become a rushing torrent, a devastating flood, washing away everything in its path. So it is with strife among God's people. A critical word, an uncharitable thought, a perceived slight, a refusal to forgive â€“ these are the tiny trickles. They seem insignificant at first. Yet, if left unchecked, they quickly escalate, eroding relationships, dividing families, and even tearing apart a church body. Once the "water is let out," it becomes exceedingly difficult to contain the damage. Bitterness takes root, gossip spreads, and misunderstandings multiply, leading to deep divisions.

The wise Solomon, guided by the Holy Spirit, gives us a direct command: "therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with." This isn't a suggestion; it's an imperative. "Before it be meddled with" means stopping it before it becomes entangled, before it deepens, before it's too late. It calls for proactive spiritual vigilance. As believers, we are called to be instruments of peace, not instigators of conflict. This means exercising self-control over our tongues, tempers, and thoughts. When a disagreement or offense occurs, our first instinct should not be to defend ourselves, retaliate, or stew in resentment. Instead, we choose humility, forgiveness, and reconciliation. It means being quick to apologize, quick to forgive, and quick to seek understanding, even sacrificing our pride.

In our homes, workplaces, and especially the church, opportunities for strife inevitably arise. How will we respond? Will we allow the "trickle" to become a flood, or prayerfully and purposefully "leave off contention"? Let us remember our Lord's words, "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matthew 5:9, KJV). May we actively seek to mend breaches, speak words that build up, and prioritize unity in Christ. Let us be vigilant against the smallest beginnings of strife, for our witness and the body's health depend upon it.

Heavenly Father, grant us wisdom and grace to leave off contention, and to be quick to promote peace in all our interactions, for Your glory. Amen.
