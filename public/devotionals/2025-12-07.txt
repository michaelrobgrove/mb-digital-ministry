# The Pursuit and Preservation of Godly Wisdom

Today's verse from Proverbs 4:5 issues a powerful threefold command, echoing the heart of our Heavenly Father who desires His children to walk in paths of righteousness and truth: "Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth." This isn't merely good advice; it's a divine imperative for a life that honors God and blesses the believer.

First, we are commanded to "Get wisdom, get understanding." This isn't worldly cleverness or human intellect, which often puffs up and leads astray. The wisdom spoken of here is divine wisdom, rooted in the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 9:10). It is the ability to see life from God's perspective, to discern His will, and to apply His truth to every situation. Understanding is the comprehension that accompanies this wisdom, allowing us to grasp the meaning and implications of God's ways. How do we "get" it? It’s not passively received but actively pursued. We find it by diligently studying God's precious Word, spending time in prayer, seeking the counsel of godly mentors, and committing to a life of obedience. It is a treasure far more valuable than gold or rubies, for it guides our steps and illuminates our path.

Secondly, the verse instructs us to "forget it not." Once we have earnestly sought and received this divine wisdom and understanding, the battle is not over. Our fallen nature is prone to forgetfulness, to allow the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of sin, or the distractions of life to erode the truths we have learned. To "forget it not" means to actively retain it in our hearts and minds. It calls for meditation on scripture, memorization of key verses, and a consistent effort to remember God's faithfulness and His unchanging principles. Just as we wouldn't forget our loved ones, we must not forget the foundational truths that anchor our souls.

Finally, we are warned, "neither decline from the words of my mouth." The "words of my mouth" are ultimately the authoritative and infallible words of God, as revealed in the Holy Bible. To decline from them means to turn away, to deviate, to disregard, or to disobey. It’s not enough to simply know God's truth and remember it; we must live by it. This is a call to steadfast obedience, a commitment to allow God's Word to be the final authority in every decision, every thought, and every action. When we decline from His words, we step out of His perfect will, invite confusion, and hinder our spiritual growth. A life truly aligned with Christ is one that consistently embraces, remembers, and obeys God's sacred commands.

Let us, therefore, with earnest hearts, pursue God's wisdom and understanding, diligently guarding it against forgetfulness, and steadfastly refusing to decline from the life-giving words of our Almighty God.

Heavenly Father, grant us the grace to seek, retain, and obey Your precious Word today and always.
